"Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators."
" Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health."
" Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals."
" In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other."
" Some sports allow a ""tie"" or ""draw"", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser."
 A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion.
" Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs."
"Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition."
" Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports."
" However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports."
" The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports."
"Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner."
 Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first.
" It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression."
"Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news."
" Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting."
" Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport."
" Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013."
" The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport."
"The word ""sport"" comes from the Old French desport meaning ""leisure"", with the oldest definition in English from around 1300 being ""anything humans find amusing or entertaining""."
"Other meanings include gambling and events staged for the purpose of gambling; hunting; and games and diversions, including ones that require exercise."
" Roget's defines the noun sport as an ""activity engaged in for relaxation and amusement"" with synonyms including diversion and recreation."
"The singular term ""sport"" is used in most English dialects to describe the overall concept (e."
" ""children taking part in sport""), with ""sports"" used to describe multiple activities (e."
" ""football and rugby are the most popular sports in England"")."
The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources.
" The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by SportAccord, which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including association football, athletics, cycling, tennis, equestrian sports, and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport."
"SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:
"
"not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as arena football)
"
"not rely on any ""luck"" element specifically designed into the sport."
"They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby or athletics), primarily mind (such as chess or Go), predominantly motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating), primarily co-ordination (such as billiard sports), or primarily animal-supported (such as equestrian sport)."
"The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports."
" Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports."
"There has been an increase in the application of the term ""sport"" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as video games, also called esports (from ""electronic sports""), especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations."
" According to Council of Europe, European Sports Charter, article 2."
"i, ""'Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels."
"There are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport, with almost all professional sports involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or SportAccord."
Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity.
" For instance, the Council of Europe include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun."
"In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school sports days, although moves like this are often controversial."
"In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their ""result"" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e."
" The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with ""handicaps"" or penalties."
" In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement."
" In gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective."
" There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time."
Artifacts and structures suggest sport in China as early as 2000 BC.
 Gymnastics appears to have been popular in China's ancient past.
" Monuments to the Pharaohs indicate that a number of sports, including swimming and fishing, were well-developed and regulated several thousands of years ago in ancient Egypt."
" Other Egyptian sports included javelin throwing, high jump, and wrestling."
 Ancient Persian sports such as the traditional Iranian martial art of Zoorkhaneh had a close connection to warfare skills.
 Among other sports that originated in ancient Persia are polo and jousting.
A wide range of sports were already established by the time of Ancient Greece and the military culture and the development of sport in Greece influenced one another considerably.
" Sport became such a prominent part of their culture that the Greeks created the Olympic Games, which in ancient times were held every four years in a small village in the Peloponnesus called Olympia."
Sports have been increasingly organised and regulated from the time of the ancient Olympics up to the present century.
" Industrialisation has brought increased leisure time, letting people attend and follow spectator sports and participate in athletic activities."
 These trends continued with the advent of mass media and global communication.
" Professionalism became prevalent, further adding to the increase in sport's popularity, as sports fans followed the exploits of professional athletes – all while enjoying the exercise and competition associated with amateur participation in sports."
" Since the turn of the 21st century, there has been increasing debate about whether transgender sports persons should be able to participate in sport events that conform with their post-transition gender identity."
"Sportsmanship is an attitude that strives for fair play, courtesy toward teammates and opponents, ethical behaviour and integrity, and grace in victory or defeat."
Sportsmanship expresses an aspiration or ethos that the activity will be enjoyed for its own sake.
" The well-known sentiment by sports journalist Grantland Rice, that it's ""not that you won or lost but how you played the game"", and the modern Olympic creed expressed by its founder Pierre de Coubertin: ""The most important thing."
" is not winning but taking part"" are typical expressions of this sentiment."
"Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win."
" Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage."
"Participants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains."
" The widespread existence of gambling on the results of sports fixtures creates a motivation for match fixing, where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win."
"The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means."
"All sports recognised by the IOC or SportAccord are required to implement a testing programme, looking for a list of banned drugs, with suspensions or bans being placed on participants who test positive for banned substances."
Violence in sports involves crossing the line between fair competition and intentional aggressive violence.
" Athletes, coaches, fans, and parents sometimes unleash violent behaviour on people or property, in misguided shows of loyalty, dominance, anger, or celebration."
 Rioting or hooliganism by fans in particular is a problem at some national and international sporting contests.
Female participation in sports continues to rise alongside the opportunity for involvement and the value of sports for child development and physical fitness.
" Despite increases in female participation during the last three decades, a gap persists in the enrolment figures between male and female players in sports-related teams."
 Female players account for 39% of the total participation in US interscholastic athletics.
"Youth sport presents children with opportunities for fun, socialisation, forming peer relationships, physical fitness, and athletic scholarships."
 Activists for education and the war on drugs encourage youth sport as a means to increase educational participation and to fight the illegal drug trade.
" According to the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children's Hospital, the biggest risk for youth sport is death or serious injury including concussion."
" These risks come from running, basketball, association football, volleyball, gridiron, gymnastics, and ice hockey."
 Youth sport in the US is a $15 billion industry including equipment up to private coaching.
"Disabled sports also adaptive sports or parasports, are sports played by persons with a disability, including physical and intellectual disabilities."
" As many of these are based on existing sports modified to meet the needs of persons with a disability, they are sometimes referred to as adapted sports."
" However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports."
"The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played."
 This has led to the specific phenomenon of spectator sport.
"Both amateur and professional sports attract spectators, both in person at the sport venue, and through broadcast media including radio, television and internet broadcast."
" Both attendance in person and viewing remotely can incur a sometimes substantial charge, such as an entrance ticket, or pay-per-view television broadcast."
"It is common for popular sports to attract large broadcast audiences, leading to rival broadcasters bidding large amounts of money for the rights to show certain fixtures."
 The football World Cup attracts a global television audience of hundreds of millions; the 2006 final alone attracted an estimated worldwide audience of well over 700 million and the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final  attracted an estimated audience of 135 million in India alone.
"In the United States, the championship game of the NFL, the Super Bowl, has become one of the most watched television broadcasts of the year."
"Super Bowl Sunday is a de facto national holiday in America; the viewership being so great that in 2015, advertising space was reported as being sold at $4."
"Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a wage or salary)."
" Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called ""grassroots sport""."
"The popularity of spectator sport as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high paying professional sport culture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into millions of dollars."
"Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing only amateur sport."
 The Olympic Games started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.
" From 1971, Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship, and from 1986, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, with the exceptions of boxing, and wrestling."
" With it being a necessary part of some sports (such as motorsport), it is used in others to improve performance."
 Some sports also use it to allow off-field decision making.
"Sports science is a widespread academic discipline, and can be applied to areas including athlete performance, such as the use of video analysis to fine-tune technique, or to equipment, such as improved running shoes or competitive swimwear."
" Sports engineering emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data to wearable technology."
" In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants."
" For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned by FINA, as they were enhancing swimmers' performances."
"The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions."
" In some sports, players can now challenge decisions made by officials."
" In Association football, goal-line technology makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not."
" The technology is not compulsory, but was used in the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil, and the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada, as well as in the Premier League from 2013–14, and the Bundesliga from 2015–16."
" In the NFL, a referee can ask for a review from the replay booth, or a head coach can issue a challenge to review the play using replays."
 A video referee (commonly known as a Television Match Official or TMO) can also use replays to help decision-making in rugby (both league and union).
" In international cricket, an umpire can ask the Third umpire for a decision, and the third umpire makes the final decision."
" Since 2008, a decision review system for players to review decisions has been introduced and used in ICC-run tournaments, and optionally in other matches."
" Depending on the host broadcaster, a number of different technologies are used during an umpire or player review, including instant replays, Hawk-Eye, Hot Spot and Real Time Snickometer."
 Hawk-Eye is also used in tennis to challenge umpiring decisions.
"Research suggests that sports have the capacity to connect youth to positive adult role models and provide positive development opportunities, as well as promote the learning and application of life skills."
" In recent years the use of sport to reduce crime, as well as to prevent violent extremism and radicalization, has become more widespread, especially as a tool to improve self-esteem, enhance social bonds and provide participants with a feeling of purpose."
"There is no high-quality evidence that shows the effectiveness of interventions to increase sports participation of the community in sports such as mass media campaigns, educational sessions, and policy changes."
 There is also no high-quality studies that investigate the effect of such interventions in promoting healthy behavior change in the community.
"Benito Mussolini used the 1934 FIFA World Cup, which was held in Italy, to showcase Fascist Italy."
" Adolf Hitler also used the 1936 Summer Olympics held in Berlin, and the 1936 Winter Olympics held in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, to promote the Nazi ideology of the superiority of the Aryan race, and inferiority of the Jews and other ""undesirables""."
 Germany used the Olympics to give off a peaceful image while secretly preparing for war.
"When apartheid was the official policy in South Africa, many sports people, particularly in rugby union, adopted the conscientious approach that they should not appear in competitive sports there."
" Some feel this was an effective contribution to the eventual demolition of the policy of apartheid, others feel that it may have prolonged and reinforced its worst effects."
"In the history of Ireland, Gaelic sports were connected with cultural nationalism."
" Until the mid-20th century a person could have been banned from playing Gaelic football, hurling, or other sports administered by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) if she/he played or supported Association football, or other games seen to be of British origin."
 Until recently the GAA continued to ban the playing of football and rugby union at Gaelic venues.
" This ban, also known as Rule 42, is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in Croke Park while Lansdowne Road was redeveloped into Aviva Stadium."
" Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the RUC from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban."
"Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view."
" On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the Football War."
 These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.
 Masked men entered the hotel of the Israeli Olympic team and killed many of their men.
A study of US elections has shown that the result of sports events can affect the results.
" A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences showed that when the home team wins the game before the election, the incumbent candidates can increase their share of the vote by 1."
" A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses."
" Also, when Washington Redskins win their final game before an election, then the incumbent President is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as the Redskins Rule."
"Étienne de La Boétie, in his essay Discourse on Voluntary Servitude describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them."
"Do not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy, nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths."
 Truly it is a marvellous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy.
" Plays, farces, spectacles, gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny."
" By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as naïvely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books."
Sport was an important form of worship in Ancient Greek religion.
" The ancient Olympic Games, called the Olympiad, were held in honour of the head deity, Zeus, and featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other gods."
" As many Greeks travelled to see the games, this combination of religion and sport also served as a way of uniting them."
"The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which ""human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves."
""" Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of ""collective pride"" and ""national self-deification"" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship."
"Tertullian condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting ""the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry."
""" The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:
"
"God has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness."
" Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that."
" Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them – the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ."

"The Meaning of Sports by Michael Mandel (PublicAffairs, ISBN 1-58648-252-1)."
"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps."
" The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are ""out"")."
" Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket."
" When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles."
" The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches."
"Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to Test matches played over five days."
" Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours."
" In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string."
The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century.
" It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century."
" The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches."
" The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London."
" The sport is followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies."
" Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard."
" The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country."
"Cricket is one of many games in the ""club ball"" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis."
" In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a ""wicket gate"" through which sheep were herded), that the batsman must defend."
" The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three ""groups"" of ""club ball"" games: the ""hockey group"", in which the ball is driven to and fro between two targets (the goals); the ""golf group"", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the ""cricket group"", in which ""the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it""."
"It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval period."
" Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian calendar; equating to 30 January 1598 in the Gregorian calendar)."
" The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that:
"
Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.
"Given Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c."
" The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun ""crosse"" as ""the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket"" and the verb form ""crosser"" as ""to play at cricket""."
"One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word ""cryce"" (or ""cricc"") meaning a crutch or staff."
" In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from ""cryce, Saxon, a stick""."
" In Old French, the word ""criquet"" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick."
" Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) ""krick""(-e), meaning a stick (crook)."
" Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word ""krickstoel"", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket."
" According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, ""cricket"" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i."
 Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.
"=== Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England ===
"
"Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects."
" The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that, in shape, resembled a hockey stick; the batsman defended a low, two-stump wicket; and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks."
"In 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket."
" This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or village match was played – at Chevening, Kent."
" In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex."
Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century.
" It is known, through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth."
" The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be ""profane"" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds or gambling were involved."
"According to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a ""great upsurge of sport after the Restoration"" in 1660."
" Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to £100 which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population."
" Along with prizefighting, horse racing and blood sports, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport."
" Rich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players."
" By the end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676."
" A 1697 newspaper report survives of ""a great cricket match"" played in Sussex ""for fifty guineas apiece"" – this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match."
"The patrons, and other players from the social class known as the ""gentry"", began to classify themselves as ""amateurs"" to establish a clear distinction from the professionals, who were invariably members of the working class, even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities."
" The gentry, including such high-ranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond, exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in, especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their ""social inferiors"" if they were to win their bets."
" In time, a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in first-class cricket, until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University – society insisted that such people were ""officers and gentlemen"" whose destiny was to provide leadership."
" In a purely financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term ""shamateur"" was coined to describe the practice."
The game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England's national sport.
 Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting.
" Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury."
" The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season."
 Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman.
" This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old ""hockey stick"" shape."
"The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point."
 MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket.
 New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).
The 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling.
" Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839."
" In December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship, which began in 1890."
" Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865."
" It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but, in terms of their financial gain, de facto professional."
 Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professional.
"The last two decades before the First World War have been called the ""Golden Age of cricket""."
" It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed."
"Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in Australia, the Caribbean, India, New Zealand, North America and South Africa."
" In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between the United States and Canada."
" In 1859, a team of English players went to North America on the first overseas tour."
 The first Australian team to travel overseas consisted of Aboriginal stockmen who toured England in 1868.
"In 1876–77, an England team took part in what was retrospectively recognised as the first-ever Test match at the Melbourne Cricket Ground against Australia."
" The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882, and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest."
 Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England.
"The inter-war years were dominated by Australia's Don Bradman, statistically the greatest Test batsman of all time."
" Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1930) and India (1932) before the Second World War and then Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992), Bangladesh (2000), Ireland and Afghanistan (both 2018) in the post-war period."
 South Africa was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 as part of the apartheid boycott.
Cricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant.
" As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased."
" The first Limited Overs International was played in 1971 and the governing International Cricket Council (ICC), seeing its potential, staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975."
" In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20, made an immediate impact."
" On 22 June 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the 11th and 12th ICC full members, enabling them to play Test cricket."
"In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called ""the Laws"") which has a global remit."
" The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London."
"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players each."
" The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length."
"In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart."
"0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting)."
 Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.
"As illustrated above, the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases."
" The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet eight inches long."
" The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), it is, in fact, unlimited in length."
" The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length."
"Before a match begins, the team captains (who are also players) toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings."
 Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match.
" In each innings, one team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other team bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen."
" When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match."
 A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day.
" During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time."
" The exception to this is if a batsman has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run, in this case the batsman is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batsman hits a scoring run or runs, though this does not apply in international cricket."
" The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied."
"The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but, in some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batsmen in their final innings in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn."
" If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have ""lost by n runs"" (where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams)."
" If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have ""won by n wickets"", where n is the number of wickets left to fall."
" For example, a team that passes its opponents' total having lost six wickets (i."
", six of their batsmen have been dismissed) have won the match ""by four wickets""."
"In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total."
" The team with the greater score is then said to have ""won by an innings and n runs"", and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores."
" If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening in first-class matches from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017."
" In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw."
"If the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of overs applies to each innings."
" Such a match is called a ""limited overs"" or ""one-day"" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur."
" If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score."
" A one-day match can also be declared a ""no-result"" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather."
"In all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue."
" There have been instances of entire matches, even Test matches scheduled to be played over five days, being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled: for example, the third Test of the 1970/71 series in Australia."
The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match.
" Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings."
" Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so."
" The innings terminates if the batting team is ""all out"", a term defined by the Laws: ""at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available to come in""."
" In this situation, one of the batsmen has not been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress."
"An innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen:
"
"the batting team's captain may declare the innings closed even though some of his players have not had a turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings
"
"the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time
"
"in the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game."
"The Laws state that, throughout an innings, ""the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls""."
" The name ""over"" came about because the umpire calls ""Over!"" when six balls have been bowled."
" At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not."
" A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a ""spell""."
" The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa."
" The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at ""square leg"" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa."
"The wicket-keeper (a specialized fielder behind the batsman) and the batsmen wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and presents a major health and safety concern."
" Protective clothing includes pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves or wicket-keeper's gloves for the hands, a safety helmet for the head and a box for male players inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area)."
" Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads."
 The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batsman (i.
", if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards."
"Subject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woolen pullover (if needed); cricket cap (for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction."
" The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket but, in limited overs cricket, team colours are worn instead."
", bowls) the ball from his or her end of the pitch towards the batsman who, armed with a bat, is ""on strike"" at the other end (see next sub-section: Basic gameplay)."
"The bat is made of wood, usually salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle."
8 cm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches (97 cm).
" There is no standard for the weight, which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1."
"The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 inches (23 cm)."
" The ball has a ""seam"": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior."
 The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner.
" During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable;  during the course of this deterioration, its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match."
" Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties."
" Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing through the air, but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam are illegal ball tampering."
"During normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field."
 Two of the players are batsmen and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team.
 The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion.
 The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch.
"In the photo, the two batsmen (3 & 8; wearing yellow) have taken position at each end of the pitch (6)."
" Three members of the fielding team (4, 10 & 11; wearing dark blue) are in shot."
 One of the two umpires (1; wearing white hat) is stationed behind the wicket (2) at the bowler's (4) end of the pitch.
" The bowler (4) is bowling the ball (5) from his end of the pitch to the batsman (8) at the other end who is called the ""striker""."
" The other batsman (3) at the bowling end is called the ""non-striker""."
" The wicket-keeper (10), who is a specialist, is positioned behind the striker's wicket (9) and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called ""first slip"" (11)."
" While the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only, the two batsmen and the wicket-keeper are wearing protective gear including safety helmets, padded gloves and leg guards (pads)."
"While the umpire (1) in shot stands at the bowler's end of the pitch, his colleague stands in the outfield, usually in or near the fielding position called ""square leg"", so that he is in line with the popping crease (7) at the striker's end of the pitch."
 The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases (12).
" The bowler (4) intends to hit the wicket (9) with the ball (5) or, at least, to prevent the striker (8) from scoring runs."
" The striker (8) intends, by using his bat, to defend his wicket and, if possible, to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs."
"Some players are skilled in both batting and bowling, or as either or these as well as wicket-keeping, so are termed all-rounders."
"  Bowlers are classified according to their style, generally as fast bowlers, seam bowlers or spinners."
 Batsmen are classified according to whether they are right-handed or left-handed.
"Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above."
" The other eight are elsewhere on the field, their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler."
" Fielders often change position between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or bowler."
"If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him, but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket."
 The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.
 The Laws of Cricket were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers.
"Most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler, although some are all-rounders and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally."
 The specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively.
" If the captain wants a bowler to ""change ends"", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate."
"A bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a ""run-up"" and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run-up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being ""in play""."
" Fast bowlers, needing momentum, take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling."
" The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly."
 Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing (i.
" This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot, for example, so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be ""caught behind"" by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder."
 At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman.
" A spinner will often ""buy his wicket"" by ""tossing one up"" (in a slower, steeper parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot."
" The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often ""flighted"" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be ""trapped"" into getting himself out."
 In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration.
There are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed: five relatively common and five extremely rare.
" The common forms of dismissal are bowled, caught, leg before wicket (lbw), run out and stumped."
" Rare methods are hit wicket, hit the ball twice, obstructing the field, handled the ball and timed out."
" The Laws state that the fielding team, usually the bowler in practice, must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision."
" If the batsman is out, the umpire raises a forefinger and says ""Out!""; otherwise, he will shake his head and say ""Not out""."
" There is, effectively, an eleventh method of dismissal, retired out, which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited."
"Batsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team."
" Substitute batsmen are generally not allowed, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket."
In order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance.
" Standardly, this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot."
"A skilled batsman can use a wide array of ""shots"" or ""strokes"" in both defensive and attacking mode."
 The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade.
" If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an ""edge""."
 The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper.
" Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat."
" Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply ""blocking"" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run."
" A wide variety of shots are played, the batsman's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e."
" the ""striker"") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball."
" To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run)."
 Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.
"The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: usually ""yes"", ""no"" or ""wait""."
" More than one run can be scored from a single hit: hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more."
" To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary."
" Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of ""overthrows"" by a fielder returning the ball."
" If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker."
" Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total."
"Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called ""sundries"" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side."
" This is achieved in four ways: no-ball, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules; wide, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach; bye, an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way; leg bye, as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman's body, though not his bat."
" If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i."
", delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball."
"The captain is often the most experienced player in the team, certainly the most tactically astute, and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batsman, a bowler or a wicket-keeper."
" Within the Laws, the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves ""within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws""."
"The wicket-keeper (sometimes called simply the ""keeper"") is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about his equipment and demeanour."
 He is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards.
" Depending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batsmen or specialist bowlers."
" Generally, a team will include five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers, plus the wicket-keeper."
"The game on the field is regulated by the two umpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called ""square leg"" which is about 15–20 metres away from the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard."
 The umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.
", not a no-ball or a wide); when a run is scored; whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase ""How's that?"" or ""Owzat?""); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game."
" The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light."
"Off the field in televised matches, there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence."
 The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries.
 These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game.
"The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team."
" The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right)."
" For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs."
" The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game."
" Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks and runs were originally called notches."
" According to Rowland Bowen, the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in 1776 by T."
 It is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at Lord's for the first time in 1846.
"Besides observing the Laws, cricketers must respect the ""Spirit of Cricket"", a concept encompassing sportsmanship, fair play and mutual respect."
 This spirit has long been considered an integral part of the sport but is only nebulously defined.
" Amidst concern that the spirit was weakening, in 2000 a Preamble was added to the Laws instructing all participants to play within the spirit of the game."
" The Preamble was last updated in 2017, now opening with the line:
"
"""Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only
"
"according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket""."
"The Preamble is a short statement intended to emphasise the ""positive behaviours that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship, and teamwork."
""" Its second line states that ""the major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all
"
"players, match officials and, especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents."
 They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player.
"Previous versions of the Spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary (for example, appealing knowing that the batsman is not out) but all specifics are now covered in the Laws of Cricket, the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes, or left to the judgement of the umpires, captains, their clubs and governing bodies."
 The terse expression of the Spirit of Cricket now avoids the diversity of cultural conventions that exist in the detail of sportsmanship – or its absence.
 International development began at the start of the 20th century and the first Test Match was played between Australia and England in December 1934.
" The following year, New Zealand women joined them, and in 2007 Netherlands women became the tenth women's Test nation when they made their debut against South Africa women."
" In 1958, the International Women's Cricket Council was founded (it merged with the ICC in 2005)."
" In 1973, the first Cricket World Cup of any kind took place when a Women's World Cup was held in England."
"  In 2005, the International Women's Cricket Council was merged with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form one unified body to help manage and develop cricket."
 The ICC Women's Rankings were launched on 1 October 2015 covering all three formats of women's cricket.
" In October 2018 following the ICC's decision to award T20 International status to all members, the Women's rankings were split into separate ODI (for Full Members) and T20I lists."
"The International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the global governing body of cricket."
" It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and took up its current name in 1989."
" The ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and can play Test cricket."
" The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the men's and women's versions of the Cricket World Cup."
" It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals."
"Each member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, selects the national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team."
" In the West Indies, which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed by Cricket West Indies."
"The table below lists the ICC full members and their national cricket boards:
"
"Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into first-class cricket, limited overs cricket and, historically, single wicket cricket."
" The highest standard is Test cricket (always written with a capital ""T"") which is in effect the international version of first-class cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC (see above)."
" Although the term ""Test match"" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–77 Australian season; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes."
" The term ""first-class"", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket."
" Test matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result."
"Limited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day, and the teams are allotted one innings each."
 There are two types: List A which normally allows fifty overs per team; and Twenty20 in which the teams have twenty overs each.
 Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as Limited Overs Internationals (LOI) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20I).
 List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs.
 The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971.
" In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England."
" Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session."
" Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a ""no result""."
Single wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches were generally considered top-class.
" In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts."
 Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began.
 Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.
Cricket is played at both the international and domestic level.
" There is one major international championship per format, and top-level domestic competitions mirror the three main international formats."
" There are now a number of T20 leagues, which have spawned a ""T20 freelancer"" phenomenon."
"Most international matches are played as parts of 'tours', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months, and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation."
" Sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which is The Ashes."
"The ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy."
" A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the ICC World Test Championship, had been proposed several times, and its first instance began in 2019."
" A league competition for ODIs, the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, began in August 2020."
" The ICC maintains Test rankings, ODI rankings and T20 rankings systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket."
"Competitions for member nations of the ICC with Associate status include the ICC Intercontinental Cup, for first-class cricket matches, and the World Cricket League for one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as the ICC World Cup Qualifier."
First-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the County Championship.
 The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890.
" The most successful club has been Yorkshire, who had won 32 official titles (plus one shared) as of 2019."
Australia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the Sheffield Shield was introduced.
" In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states."
The other ICC full members have national championship trophies called the Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament (Afghanistan); the National Cricket League (Bangladesh); the Ranji Trophy (India); the Inter-Provincial Championship (Ireland); the Plunket Shield (New Zealand); the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (Pakistan); the Currie Cup (South Africa); the Premier Trophy (Sri Lanka); the Shell Shield (West Indies); and the Logan Cup (Zimbabwe).
"The world's earliest known cricket match was a village cricket meeting in Kent which has been deduced from a 1640 court case recording a ""cricketing"" of ""the Weald and the Upland"" versus ""the Chalk Hill"" at Chevening ""about thirty years since"" (i."
 Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century and continued to develop through the 18th with the first local leagues being founded in the second half of the 19th.
"At the grassroots level, local club cricket is essentially an amateur pastime for those involved but still usually involves teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening."
" Schools cricket, first known in southern England in the 17th century, has a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular."
" Although there can be variations in game format, compared with professional cricket, the Laws are always observed and club/school matches are therefore formal and competitive events."
 The sport has numerous informal variants such as French cricket.
"Cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere."
" It has, for example, influenced the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with various phrases such as ""that's not cricket"" (that's unfair), ""had a good innings"" (lived a long life) and ""sticky wicket""."
" ""On a sticky wicket"" (aka ""sticky dog"" or ""glue pot"") is a metaphor used to describe a difficult circumstance."
" It originated as a term for difficult batting conditions in cricket, caused by a damp and soft pitch."
"Cricket is the subject of works by noted English poets, including William Blake and Lord Byron."
" James, is often named the best book on any sport ever written."
"In the visual arts, notable cricket paintings include Albert Chevallier Tayler's Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury (1907) and Russell Drysdale's The Cricketers (1948), which has been called ""possibly the most famous Australian painting of the 20th century."
""" French impressionist Camille Pissarro painted cricket on a visit to England in the 1890s."
" Francis Bacon, an avid cricket fan, captured a batsman in motion."
" Caribbean artist Wendy Nanan's cricket images are featured in a limited edition first day cover for Royal Mail's ""World of Invention"" stamp issue, which celebrated the London Cricket Conference 1–3 March 2007, first international workshop of its kind and part of the celebrations leading up to the 2007 Cricket World Cup."
Cricket has close historical ties with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports.
" In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a ""foot-ball club"" with ""a code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season."
" The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game."
"In England, a number of association football clubs owe their origins to cricketers who sought to play football as a means of keeping fit during the winter months."
 Derby County was founded as a branch of the Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884; Aston Villa (1874) and Everton (1876) were both founded by members of church cricket teams.
" Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground was, from 1854, the home of the Sheffield Cricket Club, and then of Yorkshire; it was not used for football until 1862 and was shared by Yorkshire and Sheffield United from 1889 to 1973."
"In the late 19th century, a former cricketer, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was credited with devising the baseball box score (which he adapted from the cricket scorecard) for reporting game events."
 The first box score appeared in an 1859 issue of the Clipper.
" The statistical record is so central to the game's ""historical essence"" that Chadwick is sometimes referred to as ""the Father of Baseball"" because he facilitated the popularity of the sport in its early days."

"Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal."
"  Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used."
 Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football.
 These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
"There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world."
 Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.
 The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.
"  By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage."
"  In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions."
" During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world."
"The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited."
Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.
"Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line."
Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.
"In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking."
" In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts."
"There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word ""football""."
"  It is widely assumed that the word ""football"" (or the phrase ""foot ball"") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball."
"  There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot."
"The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠) resembles modern association football (soccer), descriptions appear in a military manual dated to the second and third centuries BC."
"  It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and third centuries BC."
"  The Japanese version of cuju is kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period."
 This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial court in Kyoto from about 600 AD.
" In kemari several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie)."
"The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet."
" The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as ""ἐπίσκυρος"" (Episkyros) or ""φαινίνδα"" (phaininda), which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c."
 The Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop.
" Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis."
 Episkyros is recognised as an early form of football by FIFA.
"There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world."
" For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland."
" There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk."
" Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal."
" In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman."
" Pasuckuakohowog, a game similar to modern-day association football played amongst Amerindians, was also reported as early as the 17th century."
"Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports."
" Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of ""football."
"On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for ""game ball"")."
" The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: ""Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it."
""" Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football."
"The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Ki-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target."
" However, the main sources of modern football codes appear to lie in western Europe, especially England."
"Mahmud al-Kashgari in his Dīwān Lughāt al-Turk, described a game called ""tepuk"" among Turks in Central Asia."
" In the game, people try to attack each other's castle by kicking a ball made of sheep leather."
"The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England."
" An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th century Historia Brittonum, which describes ""a party of boys ."
" References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, date from the 12th century."
"The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as ""mob football"", would be played in towns or between neighbouring villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse, struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes."
" The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter, and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below)."
The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183.
" He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:
"
After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game.
 The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls.
" Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents."
"Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of ""ball play"" or ""playing at ball""."
 This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.
"An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England:  ""Henry."
"  Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a ""football game"" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard."
"  Another reference to a football game comes in 1321 at Shouldham, Norfolk, England: ""[d]uring the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his."
"In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time."
" A translation reads: ""[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."
"In 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning ""."
"handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games"", showing that ""football"" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball."
"A game known as ""football"" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906."
" There is evidence for schoolboys playing a ""football"" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball."
" The word ""pass"" in the most recent translation is derived from ""huc percute"" (strike it here) and later ""repercute pilam"" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin."
 It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team.
" The original word translated as ""goal"" is ""metum"", literally meaning the ""pillar at each end of the circus course"" in a Roman chariot race."
" There is a reference to ""get hold of the ball before [another player] does"" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed."
" One sentence states in the original 1930 translation ""Throw yourself against him"" (Age, objice te illi)."
"King Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word ""football"", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for ""foteball""."
"There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire."
" This is the first description of a ""kicking game"" and the first description of dribbling: ""[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game."
" It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet."
" kicking in opposite directions"" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: ""[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started."
"""a football"", in the sense of a ball rather than a game, was first mentioned in 1486."
 This reference is in Dame Juliana Berners' Book of St Albans.
"it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal."
a pair of football boots were ordered by King Henry VIII of England in 1526.
"women playing a form of football was first described in 1580 by Sir Philip Sidney in one of his poems: ""[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes."
the first references to goals are in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.
" In 1584 and 1602 respectively, John Norden and Richard Carew referred to ""goals"" in Cornish hurling."
" Carew described how goals were made: ""they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales""."
 He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players.
"the first direct reference to scoring a goal is in John Day's play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (performed circa 1600; published 1659): ""I'll play a gole at camp-ball"" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in East Anglia)."
" Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to ""when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe""."
"In the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as ""calcio storico"" (""historic kickball"") in the Piazza Santa Croce."
 The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football.
" For example, calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents."
 The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise.
" In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino."
 This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game.
 The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).
"There have been many attempts to ban football, from the middle ages through to the modern day."
 The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.
" Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s."
 Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.
"  The game played in the 19th century resembled mob football that developed in medieval Europe, including a version popular on university campuses known as Old division football, and several municipalities banned its play in the mid-19th century."
" By the 20th century, the game had evolved to a more rugby style game."
"  In 1905, there were calls to ban American football in the U."
 due to its violence; a meeting that year was hosted by American president Theodore Roosevelt led to sweeping rules changes that caused the sport to diverge significantly from its rugby roots to become more like the sport as it is played today.
"While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes."
" First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its ""mob"" form and turning it into an organised team sport."
" Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools."
" Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools."
" Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between ""kicking"" and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games first became clear."
"The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519."
" Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase ""We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde""."
"Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as ""the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football""."
 Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football.
" Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (""sides"" and ""parties""), positions (""standings""), a referee (""judge over the parties"") and a coach ""(trayning maister)""."
" Mulcaster's ""footeball"" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:
"
"[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ."
" may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges."
"In 1633, David Wedderburn, a teacher from Aberdeen, mentioned elements of modern football games in a short Latin textbook called Vocabula."
" Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as ""keeping goal"" and makes an allusion to passing the ball (""strike it here"")."
" There is a reference to ""get hold of the ball"", suggesting that some handling was allowed."
" It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (""drive that man back"")."
"A more detailed description of football is given in Francis Willughby's Book of Games, written in about 1660."
" Willughby, who had studied at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield, is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: ""a close that has a gate at either end."
""" His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field."
" He also mentions tactics (""leaving some of their best players to guard the goal""); scoring (""they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win"") and the way teams were selected (""the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"")."
" He is the first to describe a ""law"" of football: ""they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball""."
English public schools were the first to codify football games.
" In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century."
" In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were ""off their side"" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective."
" Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand."
" They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation."
" However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850."
 The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815 and Aldenham in 1825.
"During the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day."
" They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many children were part of the labour force."
" Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules."
Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit.
" Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils."
" Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse)."
 The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played.
" For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games."
"William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have ""with a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game."
" This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal."
" The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory, the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards."
The boom in rail transport in Britain during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before.
" However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules."
" The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host ""home"" school, and the other half by the visiting ""away"" school."
The modern rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century.
" This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc."
 The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first lawnmower in 1830.
" This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc."
"Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields."
" However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see Surviving UK school games below)."
"Public schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the Factory Act of 1850, which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children."
" Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day."
" These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football."
"The earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:
"
 Old Salopians (played at Cambridge University the following year).
"Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796."
"The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called ""The Foot-Ball Club"" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824–41."
  The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.
"In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school."
 These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.
"The earliest known matches involving non-public school clubs or institutions are as follows:
"
"One of the longest running football fixture is the Cordner-Eggleston Cup, contested between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne every year since 1858."
" It is believed by many to also be the first match of Australian rules football, although it was played under experimental rules in its first year."
" The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne, played in 1861 under the Melbourne Rules."
"  The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, the United Hospitals Challenge Cup (1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is the Yorkshire Cup, contested since 1878."
 The South Australian Football Association (30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition.
 The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the Youdan Cup (1867) and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup (1871).
 The Football League (1888) is recognised as the longest running Association Football league.
 The first ever international football match took place between sides representing England and Scotland on 5 March 1870 at the Oval under the authority of the FA.
"In Europe, early footballs were made out of animal bladders, more specifically pig's bladders, which were inflated."
 Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape.
" However, in 1851, Richard Lindon and William Gilbert, both shoemakers from the town of Rugby (near the school), exhibited both round and oval-shaped balls at the Great Exhibition in London."
 Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders.
" Lindon also won medals for the invention of the ""Rubber inflatable Bladder"" and the ""Brass Hand Pump""."
" inventor Charles Goodyear – who had patented vulcanised rubber – exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at the Paris Exhibition Universelle."
 The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.
"The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (see truncated icosahedron) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cup in 1970."
"The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in Aberdeen, Scotland."
"  Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('Repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time)""Scientific"" football is first recorded in 1839 from Lancashire and in the modern game in Rugby football from 1862 and from Sheffield FC as early as 1865."
"  The first side to play a passing combination game was the Royal Engineers AFC in 1869/70 By 1869 they were ""work[ing] well together"", ""backing up"" and benefiting from ""cooperation""."
" Creswell, who having brought the ball up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called""."
" By early 1872 the Engineers were the first football team renowned for ""play[ing] beautifully together""."
" A double pass is first reported from Derby school against Nottingham Forest in March 1872, the first of which is irrefutably a short pass: ""Mr Absey dribbling the ball half the length of the field delivered it to Wallis, who kicking it cleverly in front of the goal, sent it to the captain who drove it at once between the Nottingham posts""."
" The first side to have perfected the modern formation was Cambridge University AFC and introduced the 2–3–5 ""pyramid"" formation."
"During the nineteenth century, several codifications of the rules of football were made at the University of Cambridge, in order to enable students from different public schools to play each other."
  The Cambridge Rules of 1863 influenced the decision of Football Association to ban Rugby-style carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws.
"By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football."
" Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football."
"However, the club initially played its own code of football: the Sheffield rules."
" The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule."
The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football.
" These included free kicks, corner kicks, handball, throw-ins and the crossbar."
 By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England.
 At this time a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877.
"There is archival evidence of ""foot-ball"" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century."
" The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria."
"In July 1858, Tom Wills, an Australian-born cricketer educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling for a ""foot-ball club"" with a ""code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during winter."
 This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football.
" Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules, the first of which was played on 31 July 1858."
" One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College."
" Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity."
Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859.
 Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs.
 The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling.
" The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions."
" Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted ""a game of our own""."
" The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball."
The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs.
 The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs.
" Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as ""Victorian Rules"" increasingly distinct from other codes."
" It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking."
" Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world, and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition."
"During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games."
" Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called ""The Simplest Game"" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules)."
" In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster."
"At the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association (FA)."
 The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members.
" Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association."
" In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863."
" After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published."
" However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863."
 The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins).
" A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run."
" If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time."
At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed.
" Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected."
" However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA."
" After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the ""Laws of Football"", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football."
" The term ""soccer"", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of ""Association""."
"The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a mark, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal, from 15 yards (13."
"In Britain, by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game."
" There were also ""rugby"" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand."
" However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU)."
" They also included the try, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest."
"Rugby football split into Rugby union, Rugby league, American football, and Canadian football."
 Tom Wills played Rugby football in England before founding Australian rules football.
"As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students."
" For example, students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire played a game called Old division football, a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s."
" They remained largely ""mob football"" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary."
 The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them.
" Yale University, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard University followed suit in 1861."
" In its place, two general types of football evolved: ""kicking"" games and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games."
" A hybrid of the two, known as the ""Boston game"", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club."
" The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the ""Boston game"" on Boston Common."
 The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s.
" The universities of Yale, Princeton (then known as the College of New Jersey), Rutgers, and Brown all began playing ""kicking"" games during this time."
" In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English Football Association."
"In Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on 9 November 1861, at University College, University of Toronto (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park)."
" One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school."
" Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on rugby football."
" A ""running game"", resembling rugby football, was then taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868."
"On 6 November 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules."
 It is usually regarded as the first game of American intercollegiate football.
Modern North American football grew out of a match between McGill University of Montreal and Harvard University in 1874.
" During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard."
" Within a few years, Harvard had both adopted McGill's rules and persuaded other U."
" On 23 November 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit Convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, agreeing to adopt most of the Rugby Football Union rules, with some variations."
"In 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp, who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations."
 Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the down-and-distance rules.
 American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.
" President Theodore Roosevelt to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes."
" One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass."
" Though it was underutilised for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game."
"Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game."
" In 1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules, which implemented the line of scrimmage and down-and-distance system from American football, among others."
 Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.
" American and Canadian football remain different codes, stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not."
"In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as caid, remained popular in Ireland, especially in County Kerry."
" Ferris, described two main forms of caid during this period: the ""field game"" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic ""cross-country game"" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary."
" ""Wrestling"", ""holding"" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed."
"By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland."
" Trinity College Dublin was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the Developments in the 1850s section, above)."
" Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a ""rough-and-tumble game"" which allowed tripping."
"There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884."
" The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football."
 The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on 7 February 1887.
 Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football.
" The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football)."
"The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code."
 Professionalism had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.
"In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries."
" This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England."
" In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU)."
 The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements.
" However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport."
"The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better ""spectator"" sport."
" Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the line-out."
" This was followed by the replacement of the ruck with the ""play-the-ball ruck"", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled."
" Mauls were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck."
" The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the first time the name rugby league was used officially in England."
"Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as rugby union."
"The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures."
" The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress."
" It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association."
 The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.
" The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries."
"Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players."
" In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional rugby leagues were launched in Australia the following year."
" However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match."
" This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in Bordeaux."
"During the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further."
" In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of downs: a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately)."
"  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the six tackle rule."
"With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10 metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes."
"The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league."
" In particular, goals from marks were abolished, kicks directly into touch from outside the 22 metre line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ruck or maul, and the lifting of players in line-outs was legalised."
"In 1995, rugby union became an ""open"" game, that is one which allowed professional players."
 Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared – and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification – the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.
"The word football, when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above."
" Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term football, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world."
" Most often, the word ""football"" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region (which is Association football in most countries)."
" So, effectively, what the word ""football"" means usually depends on where one says it."
"In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as ""football"", while the others generally require a qualifier."
" In New Zealand, ""football"" historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football."
" The sport meant by the word ""football"" in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line)."
" In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football américain and association football is known as le soccer."
"Of the 45 national FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently use Football in their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates in Canada and the United States use Soccer in their names."
" A few FIFA affiliates have recently ""normalised"" to using ""Football"", including:
"
"Australia's association football governing body changed its name in 2005 from using ""soccer"" to ""football""
"
"New Zealand's governing body renamed itself in 2007, saying ""the international game is called football."
"Samoa changed from ""Samoa Football (Soccer) Federation"" to ""Football Federation Samoa"" in 2009."
Several of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world.
" Globally, association football is played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations, and has the highest television audience in sport, making it the most popular in the world."
"1 million high school football players and nearly 70,000 college football players, is the most popular sport in the United States, with the annual Super Bowl game accounting for nine of the top ten of the most watched broadcasts in U."
" The NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world and has the highest revenue out of any single professional sports league."
" Thus, the best association football and American football players are among the highest paid athletes in the world."
Australian rules football has the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia.
" Similarly, Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance, and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event of that nation's sporting year."
"Rugby union is the most popular sport in New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji."
 with college rugby being the fastest growing college sport in that country.
"These codes have in common the prohibition of the use of hands (by all players except the goalkeeper, though outfield players can ""throw-in"" the ball when it goes out of play), unlike other codes where carrying or handling the ball by all players is allowed

"Basketball is a team sport in which two teams, most commonly of five players each, opposing one another on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball (approximately 9."
4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.
048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.
" A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three."
" After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws."
" The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated."
"Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill."
" On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard."
" It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling."
The five players on each side fall into five playing positions.
" The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning)."
" Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one."
"Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports."
" The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition."
" Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas."
 The FIBA Basketball World Cup and Men's Olympic Basketball Tournament are the major international events of the sport and attract top national teams from around the world.
" Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA AmeriCup."
The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships.
" The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women."
"In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical education and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day."
 He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters.
" After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall."
 Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track.
" Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each ""basket"" or point scored."
" This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket."
" These round balls from ""association football"" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in."
 These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.
" Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith."
" (Whereas in American football, the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day."
") The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use."
" Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the ""bounce pass"" to teammates."
 Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls.
" Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble by 1898."
The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards.
" A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through."
" Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point."
" The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots."
 The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots.
" Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called duck on a rock, as many had failed before it."
"Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game."
 Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started.
" Mahan suggested that it be called ""Naismith ball"", at which he laughed, saying that a name like that would kill any game."
" Mahan then said, ""Why not call it basketball?"" Naismith replied, ""We have a basket and a ball, and it seems to me that would be a good name for it."
""" The first official game was played in the YMCA gymnasium in Albany, New York, on January 20, 1892, with nine players."
"6 m), on a court just half the size of a present-day Streetball or National Basketball Association (NBA) court."
"At the time, soccer was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11)."
" When winter weather got too icy to play soccer, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side."
"Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through the United States and Canada."
" By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools."
" While YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from YMCA's primary mission."
" However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void."
" In the years before World War I, the Amateur Athletic Union and the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (forerunner of the NCAA) vied for control over the rules for the game."
" The first pro league, the National Basketball League, was formed in 1898 to protect players from exploitation and to promote a less rough game."
James Naismith was instrumental in establishing college basketball.
 Beamis fielded the first college basketball team just a year after the Springfield YMCA game at the suburban Pittsburgh Geneva College.
" Naismith himself later coached at the University of Kansas for six years, before handing the reins to renowned coach Forrest ""Phog"" Allen."
" Naismith's disciple Amos Alonzo Stagg brought basketball to the University of Chicago, while Adolph Rupp, a student of Naismith's at Kansas, enjoyed great success as coach at the University of Kentucky."
" On February 9, 1895, the first intercollegiate 5-on-5 game was played at Hamline University between Hamline and the School of Agriculture, which was affiliated with the University of Minnesota."
"In 1901, colleges, including the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Cornell University, Dartmouth College, the University of Minnesota, the U."
" Naval Academy, the University of Colorado and Yale University began sponsoring men's games."
" In 1905, frequent injuries on the football field prompted President Theodore Roosevelt to suggest that colleges form a governing body, resulting in the creation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS)."
" In 1910, that body changed its name to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)."
" The first Canadian interuniversity basketball game was played at YMCA in Kingston, Ontario on February 6, 1904, when McGill University—Naismith's alma mater—visited Queen's University."
" McGill won 9–7 in overtime; the score was 7–7 at the end of regulation play, and a ten-minute overtime period settled the outcome."
"The first men's national championship tournament, the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball tournament, which still exists as the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) tournament, was organized in 1937."
" The first national championship for NCAA teams, the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) in New York, was organized in 1938; the NCAA national tournament began one year later."
" College basketball was rocked by gambling scandals from 1948 to 1951, when dozens of players from top teams were implicated in match fixing and point shaving."
" Partially spurred by an association with cheating, the NIT lost support to the NCAA tournament."
"Before widespread school district consolidation, most American high schools were far smaller than their present-day counterparts."
" During the first decades of the 20th century, basketball quickly became the ideal interscholastic sport due to its modest equipment and personnel requirements."
" In the days before widespread television coverage of professional and college sports, the popularity of high school basketball was unrivaled in many parts of America."
" Perhaps the most legendary of high school teams was Indiana's Franklin Wonder Five, which took the nation by storm during the 1920s, dominating Indiana basketball and earning national recognition."
Today virtually every high school in the United States fields a basketball team in varsity competition.
" Basketball's popularity remains high, both in rural areas where they carry the identification of the entire community, as well as at some larger schools known for their basketball teams where many players go on to participate at higher levels of competition after graduation."
" In the 2016–17 season, 980,673 boys and girls represented their schools in interscholastic basketball competition, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations."
" The states of Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky are particularly well known for their residents' devotion to high school basketball, commonly called Hoosier Hysteria in Indiana; the critically acclaimed film Hoosiers shows high school basketball's depth of meaning to these communities."
There is currently no tournament to determine a national high school champion.
 The most serious effort was the National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament at the University of Chicago from 1917 to 1930.
 The event was organized by Amos Alonzo Stagg and sent invitations to state champion teams.
 The tournament started out as a mostly Midwest affair but grew.
 Faced with opposition from the National Federation of State High School Associations and North Central Association of Colleges and Schools that bore a threat of the schools losing their accreditation the last tournament was in 1930.
 The organizations said they were concerned that the tournament was being used to recruit professional players from the prep ranks.
 The tournament did not invite minority schools or private/parochial schools.
The National Catholic Interscholastic Basketball Tournament ran from 1924 to 1941 at Loyola University.
" The National Catholic Invitational Basketball Tournament from 1954 to 1978 played at a series of venues, including Catholic University, Georgetown and George Mason."
 The National Interscholastic Basketball Tournament for Black High Schools was held from 1929 to 1942 at Hampton Institute.
 The National Invitational Interscholastic Basketball Tournament was held from 1941 to 1967 starting out at Tuskegee Institute.
 Following a pause during World War II it resumed at Tennessee State College in Nashville.
 The basis for the champion dwindled after 1954 when Brown v.
 The last tournaments were held at Alabama State College from 1964 to 1967.
" There were hundreds of men's professional basketball teams in towns and cities all over the United States, and little organization of the professional game."
 Players jumped from team to team and teams played in armories and smoky dance halls.
" Barnstorming squads such as the Original Celtics and two all-African American teams, the New York Renaissance Five (""Rens"") and the (still existing) Harlem Globetrotters played up to two hundred games a year on their national tours."
"In 1946, the Basketball Association of America (BAA) was formed."
" The first game was played in Toronto, Ontario, Canada between the Toronto Huskies and New York Knickerbockers on November 1, 1946."
" Three seasons later, in 1949, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League (NBL) to form the National Basketball Association (NBA)."
" By the 1950s, basketball had become a major college sport, thus paving the way for a growth of interest in professional basketball."
" In 1959, a basketball hall of fame was founded in Springfield, Massachusetts, site of the first game."
" Its rosters include the names of great players, coaches, referees and people who have contributed significantly to the development of the game."
 The hall of fame has people who have accomplished many goals in their career in basketball.
" An upstart organization, the American Basketball Association, emerged in 1967 and briefly threatened the NBA's dominance until the ABA-NBA merger in 1976."
" Today the NBA is the top professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition."
"The NBA has featured many famous players, including George Mikan, the first dominating ""big man""; ball-handling wizard Bob Cousy and defensive genius Bill Russell of the Boston Celtics; charismatic center Wilt Chamberlain, who originally played for the barnstorming Harlem Globetrotters; all-around stars Oscar Robertson and Jerry West; more recent big men Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal, Hakeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone; playmakers John Stockton, Isiah Thomas and Steve Nash; crowd-pleasing forwards Julius Erving and Charles Barkley; European stars Dirk Nowitzki, Pau Gasol and Tony Parker; more recent superstars LeBron James, Allen Iverson, Kobe Bryant, and Stephen Curry; and the three players who many credit with ushering the professional game to its highest level of popularity during the 1980s and 1990s: Larry Bird, Earvin ""Magic"" Johnson, and Michael Jordan."
"In 2001, the NBA formed a developmental league, the National Basketball Development League (later known as the NBA D-League and then the NBA G League after a branding deal with Gatorade)."
"FIBA (International Basketball Federation) was formed in 1932 by eight founding nations: Argentina, Czechoslovakia, Greece, Italy, Latvia, Portugal, Romania and Switzerland."
" At this time, the organization only oversaw amateur players."
" Its acronym, derived from the French Fédération Internationale de Basket-ball Amateur, was thus ""FIBA""."
" Men's basketball was first included at the Berlin 1936 Summer Olympics, although a demonstration tournament was held in 1904."
" The United States defeated Canada in the first final, played outdoors."
" This competition has usually been dominated by the United States, whose team has won all but three titles."
" The first of these came in a controversial final game in Munich in 1972 against the Soviet Union, in which the ending of the game was replayed three times until the Soviet Union finally came out on top."
" In 1950 the first FIBA World Championship for men, now known as the FIBA Basketball World Cup, was held in Argentina."
" Three years later, the first FIBA World Championship for women, now known as the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, was held in Chile."
" Women's basketball was added to the Olympics in 1976, which were held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada with teams such as the Soviet Union, Brazil and Australia rivaling the American squads."
"In 1989, FIBA allowed professional NBA players to participate in the Olympics for the first time."
" Prior to the 1992 Summer Olympics, only European and South American teams were allowed to field professionals in the Olympics."
 The United States' dominance continued with the introduction of the original Dream Team.
" In the 2004 Athens Olympics, the United States suffered its first Olympic loss while using professional players, falling to Puerto Rico (in a 19-point loss) and Lithuania in group games, and being eliminated in the semifinals by Argentina."
" It eventually won the bronze medal defeating Lithuania, finishing behind Argentina and Italy."
" The Redeem Team, won gold at the 2008 Olympics, and the B-Team, won gold at the 2010 FIBA World Championship in Turkey despite featuring no players from the 2008 squad."
" The United States continued its dominance as they won gold at the 2012 Olympics, 2014 FIBA World Cup and the 2016 Olympics."
"Worldwide, basketball tournaments are held for boys and girls of all age levels."
 The global popularity of the sport is reflected in the nationalities represented in the NBA.
 Players from all six inhabited continents currently play in the NBA.
" Top international players began coming into the NBA in the mid-1990s, including Croatians Dražen Petrović and Toni Kukoč, Serbian Vlade Divac, Lithuanians Arvydas Sabonis and Šarūnas Marčiulionis, Dutchman Rik Smits and German Detlef Schrempf."
"In the Philippines, the Philippine Basketball Association's first game was played on April 9, 1975, at the Araneta Coliseum in Cubao, Quezon City, Philippines."
" It was founded as a ""rebellion"" of several teams from the now-defunct Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association, which was tightly controlled by the Basketball Association of the Philippines (now defunct), the then-FIBA recognized national association."
" Nine teams from the MICAA participated in the league's first season that opened on April 9, 1975."
 The NBL is Australia's pre-eminent men's professional basketball league.
" The league commenced in 1979, playing a winter season (April–September) and did so until the completion of the 20th season in 1998."
" The 1998–99 season, which commenced only months later, was the first season after the shift to the current summer season format (October–April)."
 This shift was an attempt to avoid competing directly against Australia's various football codes.
 It features 8 teams from around Australia and one in New Zealand.
" A few players including Luc Longley, Andrew Gaze, Shane Heal, Chris Anstey and Andrew Bogut made it big internationally, becoming poster figures for the sport in Australia."
"Women's basketball began in 1892 at Smith College when Senda Berenson, a physical education teacher, modified Naismith's rules for women."
" Shortly after she was hired at Smith, she went to Naismith to learn more about the game."
" Fascinated by the new sport and the values it could teach, she organized the first women's collegiate basketball game on March 21, 1893, when her Smith freshmen and sophomores played against one another."
" However, the first women's interinstitutional game was played in 1892 between the University of California and Miss Head's School."
" Berenson's rules were first published in 1899, and two years later she became the editor of A."
" Berenson's freshmen played the sophomore class in the first women's intercollegiate basketball game at Smith College, March 21, 1893."
" The same year, Mount Holyoke and Sophie Newcomb College (coached by Clara Gregory Baer) women began playing basketball."
" By 1895, the game had spread to colleges across the country, including Wellesley, Vassar, and Bryn Mawr."
" The first intercollegiate women's game was on April 4, 1896."
" Stanford women played Berkeley, 9-on-9, ending in a 2–1 Stanford victory."
Women's basketball development was more structured than that for men in the early years.
" In 1905, the Executive Committee on Basket Ball Rules (National Women's Basketball Committee) was created by the American Physical Education Association."
 These rules called for six to nine players per team and 11 officials.
 The International Women's Sports Federation (1924) included a women's basketball competition.
 37 women's high school varsity basketball or state tournaments were held by 1925.
" And in 1926, the Amateur Athletic Union backed the first national women's basketball championship, complete with men's rules."
" The Edmonton Grads, a touring Canadian women's team based in Edmonton, Alberta, operated between 1915 and 1940."
" The Grads toured all over North America, and were exceptionally successful."
" They posted a record of 522 wins and only 20 losses over that span, as they met any team that wanted to challenge them, funding their tours from gate receipts."
" The Grads also shone on several exhibition trips to Europe, and won four consecutive exhibition Olympics tournaments, in 1924, 1928, 1932, and 1936; however, women's basketball was not an official Olympic sport until 1976."
" The Grads' style focused on team play, without overly emphasizing skills of individual players."
" Women's industrial leagues sprang up throughout the United States, producing famous athletes, including Babe Didrikson of the Golden Cyclones, and the All American Red Heads Team, which competed against men's teams, using men's rules."
" By 1938, the women's national championship changed from a three-court game to two-court game with six players per team."
The NBA-backed Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) began in 1997.
" Though it had shaky attendance figures, several marquee players (Lisa Leslie, Diana Taurasi, and Candace Parker among others) have helped the league's popularity and level of competition."
" Other professional women's basketball leagues in the United States, such as the American Basketball League (1996–98), have folded in part because of the popularity of the WNBA."
" In June 2007, the WNBA signed a contract extension with ESPN."
" Along with this deal, came the first-ever rights fees to be paid to a women's professional sports league."
" Over the eight years of the contract, ""millions and millions of dollars"" were ""dispersed to the league's teams."
""" In a March 12, 2009 article, NBA commissioner David Stern said that in the bad economy, ""the NBA is far less profitable than the WNBA."
Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations; international and NBA rules are used in this section.
The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own.
" A successful shot is worth two points, or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6."
75 metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games and 23 feet 9 inches (7.
 A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made.
" After a team has scored from a field goal or free throw, play is resumed with a throw-in awarded to the non-scoring team taken from a point beyond the endline of the court where the points(s) were scored."
Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA) or 12 minutes (NBA).
" College men's games use two 20-minute halves, college women's games use 10-minute quarters, and most United States high school varsity games use 8-minute quarters; however, this varies from state to state."
" 15 minutes are allowed for a half-time break under FIBA, NBA, and NCAA rules and 10 minutes in United States high schools."
" Overtime periods are five minutes in length except for high school, which is four minutes in length."
 The time allowed is actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active.
" Therefore, games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time, typically about two hours."
Five players from each team may be on the court at one time.
 Substitutions are unlimited but can only be done when play is stopped.
" Teams also have a coach, who oversees the development and strategies of the team, and other team personnel such as assistant coaches, managers, statisticians, doctors and trainers."
"For both men's and women's teams, a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey with a clearly visible number, unique within the team, printed on both the front and back."
 Players wear high-top sneakers that provide extra ankle support.
" Typically, team names, players' names and, outside of North America, sponsors are printed on the uniforms."
"A limited number of time-outs, clock stoppages requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated in the NBA) for a short meeting with the players, are allowed."
" They generally last no longer than one minute (100 seconds in the NBA) unless, for televised games, a commercial break is needed."
"The game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee (referred to as crew chief in the NBA), one or two umpires (referred to as referees in the NBA) and the table officials."
" For college, the NBA, and many high schools, there are a total of three referees on the court."
" The table officials are responsible for keeping track of each team's scoring, timekeeping, individual and team fouls, player substitutions, team possession arrow, and the shot clock."
"The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends."
" Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems."
A regulation basketball court in international games is 28 meters (92 feet) long and 15 meters (49 feet) wide.
 In the NBA and NCAA the court is 94 by 50 feet (29 by 15 meters).
" Most courts have wood flooring, usually constructed from maple planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension."
 The name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle.
The basket is a steel rim 18 inches (46 cm) diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures 6 by 3.
 The white outlined box on the backboard is 18 inches (46 cm) high and 2 feet (61 cm) wide.
" At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is exactly 10 feet (3."
" While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height – a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting."
"  The net must ""check the ball momentarily as it passes through the basket"" to aid the visual confirmation that the ball went through."
  The act of checking the ball has the further advantage of slowing down the ball so the rebound doesn't go as far.
"5 inches (75 cm) in circumference (size 7, or a ""295 ball"") and weighs 22 oz (623."
"5 inches (72 cm) in circumference (size 6, or a ""285 ball"") with a weight of 20 oz (567 grams)."
" In 3x3, a formalized version of the halfcourt 3-on-3 game, a dedicated ball with the circumference of a size 6 ball but the weight of a size 7 ball is used in all competitions (men's, women's, and mixed teams)."
"The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running)."
The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession.
" The ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line, or touches any player or object that is out of bounds."
"There are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling, which commonly results in an infraction known as traveling."
 Nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling.
" A dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name double dribble."
" Within a dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing his hand on the bottom of the ball; doing so is known as carrying the ball."
" A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it."
" For the offense, a violation of these rules results in loss of possession; for the defense, most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds."
"There are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in FIBA and the NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA and high school for both sexes), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in FIBA, the NBA, and U Sports (Canadian universities) play for both sexes, and 30 seconds in NCAA play for both sexes), holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane, (or the ""key"") (3 seconds)."
There are also limits on how players may block an opponent's field goal attempt or help a teammate's field goal attempt.
" Goaltending is a defender's touching of a ball that is on a downward flight toward the basket, while the related violation of basket interference is the touching of a ball that is on the rim or above the basket, or by a player reaching through the basket from below."
" Goaltending and basket interference committed by a defender result in awarding the basket to the offense, while basket interference committed by an offensive player results in cancelling the basket if one is scored."
 The defense gains possession in all cases of goaltending or basket interference.
An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types of physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul.
" These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well."
" Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful."
" One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4."
"The referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal, sometimes resulting in controversy."
" The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and referees."
"There is a second category of fouls called technical fouls, which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike conduct."
" These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time."
 A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA).
" In FIBA and NCAA women's basketball, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant."
"If a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) – four for NBA, NCAA women's, and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league."
" In the US college men's game and high school games for both sexes, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made."
" If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half."
"When a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air."
"After a team has committed a specified number of fouls, the other team is said to be ""in the bonus""."
" On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading ""Bonus"" or ""Penalty"" with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team."
 (Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.
"If a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play."
"If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot."
" A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot thus receives two shots, and a player fouled while attempting a three-point shot receives three shots."
"If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point."
" In combination with a regular shot, this is called a ""three-point play"" or ""four-point play"" (or more colloquially, an ""and one"") because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point)."
"Although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball."
" During the early years of basketball's evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used."
" In more recent times specific positions evolved, but the current trend, advocated by many top coaches including Mike Krzyzewski, is towards positionless basketball, where big players are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it."
"Point guard (often called the ""1"") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time."
"Shooting guard (the ""2"") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense."
"Small forward (the ""3"") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively."
"Power forward (the ""4""): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense)."
"Center (the ""5""): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound."
" For most teams today, the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called the wings, as do the power forward and center, who are often called post players."
" While most teams describe two players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a center, on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations."
There are two main defensive strategies: zone defense and man-to-man defense.
" In a zone defense, each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court."
" Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball, a manoeuver known as a trap."
" In a man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards a specific opponent."
"Offensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball."
 A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a cut.
" A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a screen or pick."
" The two plays are combined in the pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then ""rolls"" away from the pick towards the basket."
" Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork, which can lead to a successful basket."
 Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable.
" On court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur."
"Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations."
"Typically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket."
" A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball."
 The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm.
" The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through."
 Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim.
" The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended."
 Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.
The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot.
 Both are preceded by a crouching action which preloads the muscles and increases the power of the shot.
" In a set shot, the shooter straightens up and throws from a standing position with neither foot leaving the floor; this is typically used for free throws."
" For a jump shot, the throw is taken in mid-air with the ball being released near the top of the jump."
" This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender."
 Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.
" This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to ""lay"" the ball ""up"" and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a finger roll)."
" The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk, in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, through the basket while touching it."
"Another shot that is less common than the layup, is the ""circus shot""."
" The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down, and/or facing away from the basket."
" A back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket, and may be shot with the dominant hand, or both; but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful."
A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an air ball.
" A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a brick."
" The hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, layup or jump shot."
"The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard."
" This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot."
" There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball."
" The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots."
 Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.
 The ball is passed directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest.
 A proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react.
" Here, the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver."
 The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver.
" The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation)."
" Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender."
The outlet pass occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound.
The crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept.
 Good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball.
 A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate.
"Another advanced style of passing is the behind-the-back pass, which, as the description implies, involves throwing the ball behind the passer's back to a teammate."
" Although some players can perform such a pass effectively, many coaches discourage no-look or behind-the-back passes, believing them to be difficult to control and more likely to result in turnovers or violations."
Dribbling is the act of bouncing the ball continuously with one hand and is a requirement for a player to take steps with the ball.
" To dribble, a player pushes the ball down towards the ground with the fingertips rather than patting it; this ensures greater control."
"When dribbling past an opponent, the dribbler should dribble with the hand farthest from the opponent, making it more difficult for the defensive player to get to the ball."
 It is therefore important for a player to be able to dribble competently with both hands.
"Good dribblers (or ""ball handlers"") tend to bounce the ball low to the ground, reducing the distance of travel of the ball from the floor to the hand, making it more difficult for the defender to ""steal"" the ball."
" Good ball handlers frequently dribble behind their backs, between their legs, and switch directions suddenly, making a less predictable dribbling pattern that is more difficult to defend against."
" This is called a crossover, which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling."
"A skilled player can dribble without watching the ball, using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision to keep track of the ball's location."
" By not having to focus on the ball, a player can look for teammates or scoring opportunities, as well as avoid the danger of having someone steal the ball away from him/her."
"A block is performed when, after a shot is attempted, a defender succeeds in altering the shot by touching the ball."
" In almost all variants of play, it is illegal to touch the ball after it is in the downward path of its arc; this is known as goaltending."
" It is also illegal under NBA and Men's NCAA basketball to block a shot after it has touched the backboard, or when any part of the ball is directly above the rim."
 Under international rules it is illegal to block a shot that is in the downward path of its arc or one that has touched the backboard until the ball has hit the rim.
" After the ball hits the rim, it is again legal to touch it even though it is no longer considered as a block performed."
"To block a shot, a player has to be able to reach a point higher than where the shot is released."
 Players who are taller and playing the power forward or center positions generally record more blocks than players who are shorter and playing the guard positions.
" However, with good timing and a sufficiently high vertical leap, even shorter players can be effective shot blockers."
"At the professional level, most male players are above 6 feet 3 inches (1."
" Guards, for whom physical coordination and ball-handling skills are crucial, tend to be the smallest players."
 Almost all forwards in the top men's pro leagues are 6 feet 6 inches (1.
" According to a survey given to all NBA teams, the average height of all NBA players is just under 6 feet 7 inches (2."
"01 m), with the average weight being close to 222 pounds (101 kg)."
" The tallest players ever in the NBA were Manute Bol and Gheorghe Mureșan, who were both 7 feet 7 inches (2."
"18 m), Margo Dydek was the tallest player in the history of the WNBA."
The shortest player ever to play in the NBA is Muggsy Bogues at 5 feet 3 inches (1.
" Other short players have thrived at the pro level, including Anthony ""Spud"" Webb, who was just 5 feet 7 inches (1."
"1 m) vertical leap, giving him significant height when jumping, and Temeka Johnson, who won the WNBA Rookie of the Year Award and a championship with the Phoenix Mercury while standing only 5 feet 3 inches (1."
" While shorter players are often at a disadvantage in certain aspects of the game, their ability to navigate quickly through crowded areas of the court and steal the ball by reaching low are strengths."
" Many prospects exaggerate their height while in high school or college to make themselves more appealing to coaches and scouts, who prefer taller players."
" Charles Barkley stated; ""I've been measured at 6-5, 6-4 3⁄4."
""" Sam Smith, a former writer from the Chicago Tribune, said: ""We sort of know the heights, because after camp, the sheet comes out."
" Or you file your story with the right height, and the copy desk changes it because they have the 'official' N."
""" In the NBA, there is no standard on whether a player's listed height uses their measurement with shoes on or without."
" The NBA Draft Combine, which most players attend before the draft, provides both measurements."
" Thereafter, a player's team is solely responsible for their listed height, which can vary depending on the process selected."
"98 m), while his actual height is just under 6 feet 5 inches (1."
"08 m), while his actual height is just under 6 feet 8 inches (2."
"06 m)On rare occasions, some players will understate their actual heights, not to be repositioned."
" One example is Kevin Durant, whose listed height is 6 feet 9 inches (2."
" Durant's reasoning was, ""Really, that's the prototypical size for a small forward."
" Anything taller than that, and they'll start saying, 'Ah, he's a power forward."
"Variations of basketball are activities based on the game of basketball, using common basketball skills and equipment (primarily the ball and basket)."

Professional wrestling is often concluded in a raised ring; akin to boxing.
" American and British professional wrestling was considered a genuinely competitive sport up until around the mid-1920s, with occasional shoot matches still occurring well into the 1930s and 40s."
 The roots of professional wrestling lay in the catch-as-catch-can contests of the late 19th century.
" Whereas the Europeans favored the more controlled and classical Greco-Roman style, the Americans preferred the more wide-open style of wrestling that later became known as freestyle."
" When the best American catch wrestlers discovered they could earn money with their skills, the professional counterpart was born."

"  In many countries such as the UK, this form of professional wrestling achieved mainstream popularity with television making household names of its stars, but later declined and was supplanted both on television and in wider culture by imported American wrestling."

"Japanese professional wrestling, also known as puroresu, is also treated more as a sport than the entertainment style of wrestling common in North America."

""" ""There is no better base for entering into mixed martial arts than the highly successful competitor as a wrestler."
" The competitive wrestlers, the highly successful amateur wrestlers have such tremendous mental toughness."
" If you can just get through the room, the wrestling room practices at like really high level universities, NCAA division one teams; those guys are savages."
" The stuff they go through, just the overtraining, just the mental toughness that you have to develop."

"There are two major disciplines of kabaddi: ""Punjabi kabaddi"", also referred to as ""circle style"", comprises traditional forms of the sport that are played on a circular field outdoors, while the ""standard style"", played on a rectangular court indoors, is the discipline played in major professional leagues and international competitions such as the Asian Games."
"The game is known by numerous names in different parts of the Indian subcontinent, such as: kabaddi  or chedugudu in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana; kabaddi in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala; kabadi or ha-du-du in Bangladesh; bhavatik in Maldives, kauddi or kabaddi in the Punjab region; hu-tu-tu in Western India, hu-do-do in Eastern India; chadakudu in South India; kapardi in Nepal; and kabadi or sadugudu in Tamil Nadu."
"Although unverified, theories from various sources state that kabaddi originated from the Vedic period of ancient India."
" The game was said to have been popular among the Yadava people; an abhang by Tukaram stated that the god Krishna played the game in his youth, while the Mahabharata contains an account of Arjuna being able to sneak into hostile areas also take out enemies unscathed—a passage said to parallel the gameplay of kabaddi."
There are also accounts of Gautama Buddha having played the game recreationaly.
"Despite these conflicting claims, modern kabaddi is a synthesis of the game played in various forms under different names in the Indian continent."
" India has been first credited with having helped to popularise kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s, their introduction to the programme of the Indian Olympic Games in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950, and it being played as a demonstration sport at the inaugural 1951 Asian Games in New Delhi."
" These developments helped to formalize the sport, which had traditionally been played in villages, for legitimate international competition."
"After being demonstrated again at the 1982 Asian Games in Delhi, Kabaddi was added to the Asian Games' programme beginning in 1990."
"In the international team version of kabaddi, two teams of seven members each occupy opposite halves of a court of 10 by 13 metres (33 ft × 43 ft) in case of men and 8 by 12 metres (26 ft × 39 ft) in case of women."
 Each has five supplementary players held in reserve for substitution.
 The game is played with 20-minute halves with a 5-minute half break in which the teams exchange sides.
" During each play, known as a ""raid"", a player from the attacking side, known as the ""raider"", runs into the opposing team's side of the court and attempts to tag as many of the seven defending players as possible."
" The raider must cross the baulk line into the defending team's territory, and then return to their half of the field without being tackled."
" (If an attacker touches a defender and hasn't yet reached the baulk line, they don't need to reach the baulk line to score points and may return to their half of the court."
") While raiding, the raider must loudly chant kabaddi, confirming to referees that their raid is done on a single breath without inhaling."
" If the raider steps beyond the bonus line marked in the defending team's territory, they earn an additional point known as a bonus point."
" If the raider is successfully stopped (tackled), the opposite team earns a point instead."
" All players tagged are taken out of the game, but one is ""revived"" for each point a team scores from a subsequent tag or tackle."
" A raid where no points are scored by the raider is referred to as an ""empty raid""."
" By contrast, a play where the raider scores three or more points is referred to as a ""super raid""."
" If a team gets all seven players on the opposing team out at once (""All Out""), they earn two additional points and the players are placed back in the game."
There are four major forms of Indian kabaddi recognised by the amateur federation.
" In Sanjeevani kabaddi, one player is revived against one player of the opposite team who is out."
 The game is played over 40 minutes with a five-minute break between halves.
 There are seven players on each side and the team that outs all the players on the opponent's side scores four extra points.
" In Gaminee style, seven players play on each side and a player put out has to remain out until all his team members are out."
 The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent's side secures a point.
 The game continues until five or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration.
" Amar style resembles the Sanjeevani form in the time frame rule, but a player who is declared out stays inside the court while play continues."
" For every player of the opposition touched ""out"", a team earns a point."

Hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre a ball or a puck into the opponent's goal using a hockey stick.
" There are many types of hockey such as bandy, field hockey, ice hockey and rink hockey."
"In most of the world, the term hockey by itself refers to field hockey, while in Canada, the United States, Russia and most of Eastern and Northern Europe, the term usually refers to ice hockey."
"The first recorded use of the word hockey is in the 1773 book Juvenile Sports and Pastimes, to Which Are Prefixed, Memoirs of the Author: Including a New Mode of Infant Education by Richard Johnson (Pseud."
" Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled ""New Improvements on the Game of Hockey""."
" The belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by King Edward III of England is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games ""Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam""."
" The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word ""hockey"" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, instead translating ""Canibucam"" as ""Cambuck""; this may have referred to either an early form of hockey or a game more similar to golf or croquet."
" One supposition is that it is a derivative of hoquet, a Middle French word for a shepherd's stave."
" The curved, or ""hooked"" ends of the sticks used for hockey would indeed have resembled these staves."
" Another supposition derives from the known use of cork bungs (stoppers), in place of wooden balls to play the game."
" The stoppers came from barrels containing ""hock"" ale, also called ""hocky""."
Games played with curved sticks and a ball can be found in the histories of many cultures.
" In Egypt, 4000-year-old carvings feature teams with sticks and a projectile, hurling dates to before 1272 BC in Ireland, and there is a depiction from approximately 600 BC in Ancient Greece, where the game may have been called kerētízein or (κερητίζειν) because it was played with a horn or horn-like stick (kéras, κέρας)."
" In Inner Mongolia, the Daur people have been playing beikou, a game similar to modern field hockey, for about 1,000 years."
Most evidence of hockey-like games during the Middle Ages is found in legislation concerning sports and games.
" The Galway Statute enacted in Ireland in 1527 banned certain types of ball games, including games using ""hooked"" (written ""hockie"", similar to ""hooky"") sticks."
"at no tyme to use ne occupye the horlinge of the litill balle with hockie stickes or staves, nor use no hande ball to play withoute walles, but only greate foote balle 
"
"By the 19th century, the various forms and divisions of historic games began to differentiate and coalesce into the individual sports defined today."
" Organizations dedicated to the codification of rules and regulations began to form, and national and international bodies sprang up to manage domestic and international competition."
"Bandy is played with a ball on a football pitch-sized ice arena (bandy rink), typically outdoors, and with many rules similar to association football."
 The sport is recognized by the IOC; its international governing body is the Federation of International Bandy.
"Bandy has its roots in England in the 19th century, was originally called ""hockey on the ice"", and spread from England to other European countries around 1900; a similar Russian sport can also be seen as a predecessor and in Russia, bandy is sometimes called ""Russian hockey""."
 Bandy World Championships have been played since 1957 and Women's Bandy World Championships since 2004.
 There are national club championships in many countries and the top clubs in the world play in the Bandy World Cup every year.
"Field hockey is played on gravel, natural grass, or sand-based or water-based artificial turf, with a small, hard ball approximately 73 mm (2."
" The game is popular among both males and females in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Argentina."
" In most countries, the game is played between single-sex sides, although they can be mixed-sex."
The governing body is the 126-member International Hockey Federation (FIH).
" Men's field hockey has been played at each Summer Olympic Games since 1908 except for 1912 and 1924, while women's field hockey has been played at the Summer Olympic Games since 1980."
"Modern field hockey sticks are constructed of a composite of wood, glass fibre or carbon fibre (sometimes both) and are J-shaped, with a curved hook at the playing end, a flat surface on the playing side and a curved surface on the rear side."
 All sticks are right-handed – left-handed sticks are not permitted.
"While field hockey in its current form appeared in mid-18th century England, primarily in schools, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that it became firmly established."
 The first club was created in 1849 at Blackheath in south-east London.
 It was the national sport of India until the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports declared in August 2012 that India has no national sport.
"Ice hockey is played between two teams of skaters on a large flat area of ice, using a three-inch-diameter (76."
 This puck is often frozen before high-level games to decrease the amount of bouncing and friction on the ice.
" The game is played all over North America, Europe and to varying extents in many other countries around the world."
" It is the most popular sport in Canada, Finland, Latvia, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia."
 Ice hockey is the national sport of Latvia and the national winter sport of Canada.
The governing body of international play is the 77-member International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).
" Men's ice hockey has been played at the Winter Olympics since 1924, and was in the 1920 Summer Olympics."
 Women's ice hockey was added to the Winter Olympics in 1998.
" North America's National Hockey League (NHL) is the strongest professional ice hockey league, drawing top ice hockey players from around the globe."
 The NHL rules are slightly different from those used in Olympic ice hockey over many categories.
 International ice hockey rules were adopted from Canadian rules in the early 1900s.
The contemporary sport developed in Canada from European and native influences.
" These included various stick and ball games similar to field hockey, bandy and other games where two teams push a ball or object back and forth with sticks."
" These were played outdoors on ice under the name ""hockey"" in England throughout the 19th century, and even earlier under various other names."
" In Canada, there are 24 reports of hockey-like games in the 19th century before 1875 (five of them using the name ""hockey"")."
" The first organized and recorded game of ice hockey was played indoors in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, on March 3, 1875, and featured several McGill University students."
"Ice hockey sticks are long L-shaped sticks made of wood, graphite, or composites with a blade at the bottom that can lie flat on the playing surface when the stick is held upright and can legally curve either way, for left- or right-handed players."
Ice sledge hockey or para ice hockey is a form of ice hockey designed for players with physical disabilities affecting their lower bodies.
 Players sit on double-bladed sledges and use two sticks; each stick has a blade at one end and small picks at the other.
" Players use the sticks to pass, stickhandle and shoot the puck, and to propel their sledges."
"Canada is a recognized international leader in the development of sledge hockey, and much of the equipment for the sport was first developed there, such as sledge hockey sticks laminated with fiberglass, as well as aluminum shafts with hand-carved insert blades and special aluminum sledges with regulation skate blades."
"Based on ice sledge hockey, inline sledge hockey is played to the same rules as inline puck hockey (essentially ice hockey played off-ice using inline skates)."
" There is no classification point system dictating who can play inline sledge hockey, unlike the situation with other team sports such as wheelchair basketball and wheelchair rugby."
" Inline sledge hockey is being developed to allow everyone, regardless of whether they have a disability or not, to complete up to world championship level based solely on talent and ability."
" The first game of inline sledge hockey was played at Bisley, England, on 19 December 2009 between the Hull Stingrays and the Grimsby Redwings."
" Matt Lloyd is credited with inventing inline sledge hockey, and Great Britain is seen as the international leader in the game's development."
"Inline hockey is a variation of roller hockey very similar to ice hockey, from which it is derived."
" Inline hockey is played by two teams, consisting of four skaters and one goalie, on a dry rink divided into two halves by a center line, with one net at each end of the rink."
 The game is played in three 15-minute periods with a variation of the ice hockey off-side rule.
" Icings are also called, but are usually referred to as illegal clearing."
" The governing body is the IIHF, as for ice hockey, but some leagues and competitions do not follow the IIHF regulations, in particular USA Inline and Canada Inline."
"Roller hockey, also known as quad hockey, international-style ball hockey, rink hockey and Hoquei em Patins, is an overarching name for a roller sport that has existed since long before inline skates were invented."
 This sport is played in over sixty countries and has a worldwide following.
 Roller hockey was a demonstration sport at the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.
"Also known as road hockey, this is a dry-land variant of ice and roller hockey played year-round on a hard surface (usually asphalt)."
" A ball is usually used instead of a puck, and protective equipment is not usually worn."
"Other games derived from hockey or its predecessors include the following:
"
Air hockey is played indoors with a puck on an air-cushion table.
"Beach hockey, a variation of street hockey, is a common sight on Southern California beaches."
"Ball hockey is played in a gym using sticks and a ball, often a tennis ball with the felt removed."
 The object of the game is to move a hockey puck from the center of the box out through a hole placed at the end of the box (known as the goal).
" The players kneel facing one another on either side of the box, and each attempts to move the puck to the hole on their left."
"Broomball is played on an ice hockey rink, but with a ball instead of a puck and a ""broom"" (actually a stick with a small plastic implement on the end) in place of the ice hockey stick."
" Instead of skates, special shoes are used that have very soft rubbery soles to maximize grip while running around."
"Deck hockey is traditionally played by the Royal Navy on ships' decks, using short wooden L-shaped sticks."
"Floor hockey is a form of hockey played on foot, on a flat, smooth floor surface, usually indoors in gymnasiums or similar spaces."
Floorball is a form of hockey played in a gymnasium or in a sports hall.
" A whiffle ball is used instead of a plastic ball, and the sticks are only one meter long and made from composite materials."
Foot hockey or sock hockey is played using a bald tennis ball or rolled-up pair of socks and using only the feet.
"Gena is a field hockey sport played in Ethiopia, with which the Ethiopian Christmas festival shares its name."
" The equipment consists of a strong stick curved at one end, and a ball of two kinds: either called srur (made out of a rounded piece of hard-wood) or tsng (made by weaving a long strip of leather into a rounded shape)."
 It uses sticks with foam ends and a foam ball or a plastic puck.
Hurling and Camogie are Irish games bearing some resemblance to – and notable differences from – hockey.
"Mini hockey (or knee-hockey), also known as ""mini-sticks"" is a form of hockey played in the United States in the basements of houses."
" Players kneel and use a miniature plastic stick, usually about 15 inches (38 cm) long, to manoeuvre a small ball or a soft, fabric-covered mini puck into miniature goals."
"  In England 'mini hockey' refers to a seven-a-side version of field hockey for younger players, played on an area equivalent to half a normal pitch."
Nok Hockey is a table-top version of hockey played with no defence and a small block in front of the goal.
Pond hockey is a simplified form of ice hockey played on naturally frozen ice.
Power hockey is a form of hockey for persons requiring the use of an electric (power) wheelchair in daily life.
Ringette is an ice hockey variant that was designed for female players; it uses a straight stick and a rubber ring in place of a puck.
 The rules differ from those of hockey and resemble a mix of lacrosse and basketball.
Rink bandy and rinkball are team sports of Scandinavian origin that are played like bandy but on an ice hockey rink and with fewer players on each team.
Rossall hockey is a variation played at Rossall School on the sea shore in the winter months.
" Its rules are a mix of field hockey, rugby and the Eton wall game."
"Shinty is a Scottish game now played primarily in the Highlands
"
"Skater hockey is a variant of inline hockey, played with a ball."
"Spongee is a cross between ice hockey and broomball and is most popular in Manitoba, Canada."
" A stick and puck are used as in hockey (the puck is a softer version called a ""sponge puck""), and the same soft-soled shoes are worn as in broomball."
" The rules are basically the same as for ice hockey, but one variation has an extra player on the ice called a ""rover""."
Underwater hockey is played with a weighted puck on the bottom of a swimming pool.
Underwater ice hockey is similar to underwater hockey but played with floating puck on the underside of a frozen swimming pool.
Unicycle hockey is played on a hard surface using unicycles as the method of player movement.

"A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool."
" Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements."
" However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games)."
"Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well."
" They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals."
" The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship."
" On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play."
" Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player."
"Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction."
" Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both."
" Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role."
"Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures."
" The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games."
Ludwig Wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to address the definition of the word game.
" In his Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein argued that the elements of games, such as play, rules, and competition, all fail to adequately define what games are."
" From this, Wittgenstein concluded that people apply the term game to a range of disparate human activities that bear to one another only what one might call family resemblances."
" As the following game definitions show, this conclusion was not a final one and today many philosophers, like Thomas Hurka, think that Wittgenstein was wrong and that Bernard Suits' definition is a good answer to the problem."
"French sociologist Roger Caillois, in his book Les jeux et les hommes (Games and Men), defined a game as an activity that must have the following characteristics:
"
"fun: the activity is chosen for its light-hearted character
"
"non-productive: participation does not accomplish anything useful
"
"governed by rules: the activity has rules that are different from everyday life
"
"fictitious: it is accompanied by the awareness of a different reality
"
Game designer Chris Crawford defined the term in the context of computers.
"Creative expression is art if made for its own beauty, and entertainment if made for money."
A piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive.
 Movies and books are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment.
" (Crawford notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are toys, not games."
"If a challenge has no ""active agent against whom you compete"", it is a puzzle; if there is one, it is a conflict."
 Video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in Pac-Man.
"Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not attack them to interfere with their performance, the conflict is a competition."
") However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a game."
"Crawford's definition may thus be rendered as: an interactive, goal-oriented activity made for money, with active agents to play against, in which players (including active agents) can interfere with each other."
"Other definitions, however, as well as history, show that entertainment and games are not necessarily undertaken for monetary gain."
"""A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome."
"""A game is a form of art in which participants, termed players, make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal."
""" (Greg Costikyan) According to this definition, some ""games"" that do not involve choices, such as Chutes and Ladders, Candy Land, and War are not technically games any more than a slot machine is."
"""A game is an activity among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context."
"""At its most elementary level then we can define game as an exercise of voluntary control systems in which there is an opposition between forces, confined by a procedure and rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome."
"""to play a game is to engage in activity directed toward bringing about a specific state of affairs, using only means permitted by specific rules, where the means permitted by the rules are more limited in scope than they would be in the absence of the rules, and where the sole reason for accepting such limitation is to make possible such activity."
"""When you strip away the genre differences and the technological complexities, all games share four defining traits: a goal, rules, a feedback system, and voluntary participation."
 Major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of game.
Games are often classified by the components required to play them (e.
" miniatures, a ball, cards, a board and pieces, or a computer)."
" In places where the use of leather is well-established, the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history, resulting in a worldwide popularity of ball games such as rugby, basketball, soccer (football), cricket, tennis, and volleyball."
" Many countries in Europe, for instance, have unique standard decks of playing cards."
 Other games such as chess may be traced primarily through the development and evolution of its game pieces.
"Many game tools are tokens, meant to represent other things."
" A token may be a pawn on a board, play money, or an intangible item such as a point scored."
"Games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not use any obvious tool; rather, their interactivity is defined by the environment."
 Games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is altered.
" For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game in a park; an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course, even with the same cars."
"Whereas games are often characterized by their tools, they are often defined by their rules."
" While rules are subject to variations and changes, enough change in the rules usually results in a ""new"" game."
" For instance, baseball can be played with ""real"" baseballs or with wiffleballs."
" However, if the players decide to play with only three bases, they are arguably playing a different game."
" There are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own rules, but even then there are often immutable meta-rules."
"Rules generally determine the time-keeping system, the rights and responsibilities of the players, and each player's goals."
 Player rights may include when they may spend resources or move tokens.
" For most competitive games, the ultimate aim is winning: in this sense, checkmate is the aim of chess."
" Common win conditions are being first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens (as in Settlers of Catan), having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the game (as in Monopoly), or some relationship of one's game tokens to those of one's opponent (as in chess's checkmate)."
" There may also be intermediate aims, which are tasks that move a player toward winning."
" For instance, an intermediate aim in football is to score goals, because scoring goals will increase one's likelihood of winning the game, but isn't alone sufficient to win the game."
"An aim identifies a sufficient condition for successful action, whereas the rule identifies a necessary condition for permissible action."
" For example, the aim of chess is to checkmate, but although it is expected that players will try to checkmate each other, it is not a rule of chess that a player must checkmate the other player whenever possible."
" Similarly, it is not a rule of football that a player must score a goal on a penalty; while it is expected the player will try, it is not required."
" While meeting the aims often requires a certain degree of skill and (in some cases) luck, following the rules of a game merely requires knowledge of the rules and some careful attempt to follow them; it rarely (if ever) requires luck or demanding skills."
"A game's tools and rules will result in its requiring skill, strategy, luck, or a combination thereof, and are classified accordingly."
"Games of skill include games of physical skill, such as wrestling, tug of war, hopscotch, target shooting, and stake, and games of mental skill such as checkers and chess."
" Games of strategy include checkers, chess, Go, arimaa, and tic-tac-toe, and often require special equipment to play them."
" Games of chance include gambling games (blackjack, Mahjong, roulette, etc."
"), as well as snakes and ladders and rock, paper, scissors; most require equipment such as cards or dice."
" However, most games contain two or all three of these elements."
" For example, American football and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy while tiddlywinks, poker, and Monopoly combine strategy and chance."
" Many card and board games combine all three; most trick-taking games involve mental skill, strategy, and an element of chance, as do many strategic board games such as Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Carcassonne."
" However, single-player games are unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces."
" Unlike a game with multiple players competing with or against each other to reach the game's goal, a one-player game is a battle solely against an element of the environment (an artificial opponent), against one's own skills, against time, or against chance."
 Playing with a yo-yo or playing tennis against a wall is not generally recognized as playing a game due to the lack of any formidable opposition.
" Many games described as ""single-player"" may be termed actually puzzles or recreations."
A multiplayer game is a game of several players who may be independent opponents or teams.
 Games with many independent players are difficult to analyze formally using game theory as the players may form and switch coalitions.
" The term ""game"" in this context may mean either a true game played for entertainment or a competitive activity describable in principle by mathematical game theory."
John Nash proved that games with several players have a stable solution provided that coalitions between players are disallowed.
 Nash won the Nobel prize for economics for this important result which extended von Neumann's theory of zero-sum games.
"If cooperation between players is allowed, then the game becomes more complex; many concepts have been developed to analyze such games."
" While these have had some partial success in the fields of economics, politics and conflict, no good general theory has yet been developed."
"In quantum game theory, it has been found that the introduction of quantum information into multiplayer games allows a new type of equilibrium strategy not found in traditional games."
 The entanglement of players's choices can have the effect of a contract by preventing players from profiting from what is known as betrayal.
"Games can take a variety of forms, from competitive sports to board games and video games."
"Many sports require special equipment and dedicated playing fields, leading to the involvement of a community much larger than the group of players."
 A city or town may set aside such resources for the organization of sports leagues.
Popular sports may have spectators who are entertained just by watching games.
 A community will often align itself with a local sports team that supposedly represents it (even if the team or most of its players only recently moved in); they often align themselves against their opponents or have traditional rivalries.
"Certain competitive sports, such as racing and gymnastics, are not games by definitions such as Crawford's (see above) – despite the inclusion of many in the Olympic Games – because competitors do not interact with their opponents; they simply challenge each other in indirect ways."
"Lawn games are outdoor games that can be played on a lawn; an area of mowed grass (or alternately, on graded soil) generally smaller than a sports field (pitch)."
" Variations of many games that are traditionally played on a sports field are marketed as ""lawn games"" for home use in a front or back yard."
" Common lawn games include horseshoes, sholf, croquet, bocce, and lawn bowls."
"A tabletop game is a game where the elements of play are confined to a small area and require little physical exertion, usually simply placing, picking up and moving game pieces."
 Most of these games are played at a table around which the players are seated and on which the game's elements are located.
" However, many games falling into this category, particularly party games, are more free-form in their play and can involve physical activity such as mime."
" Still, these games do not require a large area in which to play them, large amounts of strength or stamina, or specialized equipment other than what comes in a box."
"This class of games includes any game in which the skill element involved relates to manual dexterity or hand-eye coordination, but excludes the class of video games (see below)."
" Games such as jacks, paper football, and Jenga require only very portable or improvised equipment and can be played on any flat level surface, while other examples, such as pinball, billiards, air hockey, foosball, and table hockey require specialized tables or other self-contained modules on which the game is played."
" The advent of home video game systems largely replaced some of these, such as table hockey, however air hockey, billiards, pinball and foosball remain popular fixtures in private and public game rooms."
" These games and others, as they require reflexes and coordination, are generally performed more poorly by intoxicated persons but are unlikely to result in injury because of this; as such the games are popular as drinking games."
" In addition, dedicated drinking games such as quarters and beer pong also involve physical coordination and are popular for similar reasons."
"Board games use as a central tool a board on which the players' status, resources, and progress are tracked using physical tokens."
" Most games that simulate war are board games (though a large number of video games have been created to simulate strategic combat), and the board may be a map on which the players' tokens move."
" Virtually all board games involve ""turn-based"" play; one player contemplates and then makes a move, then the next player does the same, and a player can only act on their turn."
" This is opposed to ""real-time"" play as is found in some card games, most sports and most video games."
"Some games, such as chess and Go, are entirely deterministic, relying only on the strategy element for their interest."
" Such games are usually described as having ""perfect information""; the only unknown is the exact thought processes of one's opponent, not the outcome of any unknown event inherent in the game (such as a card draw or die roll)."
" Children's games, on the other hand, tend to be very luck-based, with games such as Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders having virtually no decisions to be made."
" By some definitions, such as that by Greg Costikyan, they are not games since there are no decisions to make which affect the outcome."
" Many other games involving a high degree of luck do not allow direct attacks between opponents; the random event simply determines a gain or loss in the standing of the current player within the game, which is independent of any other player; the ""game"" then is actually a ""race"" by definitions such as Crawford's."
Most other board games combine strategy and luck factors; the game of backgammon requires players to decide the best strategic move based on the roll of two dice.
 Trivia games have a great deal of randomness based on the questions a person gets.
 German-style board games are notable for often having rather less of a luck factor than many board games.
"Board game groups include race games, roll-and-move games, abstract strategy games, word games, and wargames, as well as trivia and other elements."
" Some board games fall into multiple groups or incorporate elements of other genres: Cranium is one popular example, where players must succeed in each of four skills: artistry, live performance, trivia, and language."
" These cards may be a standard Anglo-American (52-card) deck of playing cards (such as for bridge, poker, Rummy, etc."
"), a regional deck using 32, 36 or 40 cards and different suit signs (such as for the popular German game skat), a tarot deck of 78 cards (used in Europe to play a variety of trick-taking games collectively known as Tarot, Tarock or Tarocchi games), or a deck specific to the individual game (such as Set or 1000 Blank White Cards)."
 Uno and Rook are examples of games that were originally played with a standard deck and have since been commercialized with customized decks.
 Some collectible card games such as Magic: The Gathering are played with a small selection of cards that have been collected or purchased individually from large available sets.
"Some board games include a deck of cards as a gameplay element, normally for randomization or to keep track of game progress."
" Conversely, some card games such as Cribbage use a board with movers, normally to keep score."
" The differentiation between the two genres in such cases depends on which element of the game is foremost in its play; a board game using cards for random actions can usually use some other method of randomization, while Cribbage can just as easily be scored on paper."
 These elements as used are simply the traditional and easiest methods to achieve their purpose.
" Board games often use dice for a randomization element, and thus each roll of the dice has a profound impact on the outcome of the game, however dice games are differentiated in that the dice do not determine the success or failure of some other element of the game; they instead are the central indicator of the person's standing in the game."
" Popular dice games include Yahtzee, Farkle, Bunco, Liar's dice/Perudo, and Poker dice."
" As dice are, by their very nature, designed to produce apparently random numbers, these games usually involve a high degree of luck, which can be directed to some extent by the player through more strategic elements of play and through tenets of probability theory."
" Such games are thus popular as gambling games; the game of Craps is perhaps the most famous example, though Liar's dice and Poker dice were originally conceived of as gambling games."
"Domino games are similar in many respects to card games, but the generic device is instead a set of tiles called dominoes, which traditionally each have two ends, each with a given number of dots, or ""pips"", and each combination of two possible end values as it appears on a tile is unique in the set."
" The games played with dominoes largely center around playing a domino from the player's ""hand"" onto the matching end of another domino, and the overall object could be to always be able to make a play, to make all open endpoints sum to a given number or multiple, or simply to play all dominoes from one's hand onto the board."
" Sets vary in the number of possible dots on one end, and thus of the number of combinations and pieces; the most common set historically is double-six, though in more recent times ""extended"" sets such as double-nine have been introduced to increase the number of dominoes available, which allows larger hands and more players in a game."
" Muggins, Mexican Train, and Chicken Foot are very popular domino games."
" Texas 42 is a domino game more similar in its play to a ""trick-taking"" card game."
Variations of traditional dominoes abound: Triominoes are similar in theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile.
" Similarly, a game known as Quad-Ominos uses four-sided tiles."
"Some other games use tiles in place of cards; Rummikub is a variant of the Rummy card game family that uses tiles numbered in ascending rank among four colors, very similar in makeup to a 2-deck ""pack"" of Anglo-American playing cards."
 Mahjong is another game very similar to Rummy that uses a set of tiles with card-like values and art.
"Lastly, some games use graphical tiles to form a board layout, on which other elements of the game are played."
" In each, the ""board"" is made up of a series of tiles; in Settlers of Catan the starting layout is random but static, while in Carcassonne the game is played by ""building"" the board tile-by-tile."
" Hive, an abstract strategy game using tiles as moving pieces, has mechanical and strategic elements similar to chess, although it has no board; the pieces themselves both form the layout and can move within it."
"Pencil and paper games require little or no specialized equipment other than writing materials, though some such games have been commercialized as board games (Scrabble, for instance, is based on the idea of a crossword puzzle, and tic-tac-toe sets with a boxed grid and pieces are available commercially)."
" These games vary widely, from games centering on a design being drawn such as Pictionary and ""connect-the-dots"" games like sprouts, to letter and word games such as Boggle and Scattergories, to solitaire and logic puzzle games such as Sudoku and crossword puzzles."
"A guessing game has as its core a piece of information that one player knows, and the object is to coerce others into guessing that piece of information without actually divulging it in text or spoken word."
" Charades is probably the most well-known game of this type, and has spawned numerous commercial variants that involve differing rules on the type of communication to be given, such as Catch Phrase, Taboo, Pictionary, and similar."
" The genre also includes many game shows such as Win, Lose or Draw, Password and $25,000 Pyramid."
Video games are computer- or microprocessor-controlled games.
 Computers can create virtual spaces for a wide variety of game types.
" Some video games simulate conventional game objects like cards or dice, while others can simulate environs either grounded in reality or fantastical in design, each with its own set of rules or goals."
"A computer or video game uses one or more input devices, typically a button/joystick combination (on arcade games); a keyboard, mouse or trackball (computer games); or a controller or a motion sensitive tool (console games)."
 More esoteric devices such as paddle controllers have also been used for input.
"There are many genres of video game; the first commercial video game, Pong, was a simple simulation of table tennis."
" As processing power increased, new genres such as adventure and action games were developed that involved a player guiding a character from a third person perspective through a series of obstacles."
" This ""real-time"" element cannot be easily reproduced by a board game, which is generally limited to ""turn-based"" strategy; this advantage allows video games to simulate situations such as combat more realistically."
" Additionally, the playing of a video game does not require the same physical skill, strength or danger as a real-world representation of the game, and can provide either very realistic, exaggerated or impossible physics, allowing for elements of a fantastical nature, games involving physical violence, or simulations of sports."
" Lastly, a computer can, with varying degrees of success, simulate one or more human opponents in traditional table games such as chess, leading to simulations of such games that can be played by a single player."
"In more open-ended computer simulations, also known as sandbox-style games, the game provides a virtual environment in which the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of this universe."
" Sometimes, there is a lack of goals or opposition, which has stirred some debate on whether these should be considered ""games"" or ""toys""."
 (Crawford specifically mentions Will Wright's SimCity as an example of a toy.
Online games have been part of culture from the very earliest days of networked and time-shared computers.
 Early commercial systems such as Plato were at least as widely famous for their games as for their strictly educational value.
" In 1958, Tennis for Two dominated Visitor's Day and drew attention to the oscilloscope at the Brookhaven National Laboratory; during the 1980s, Xerox PARC was known mainly for Maze War, which was offered as a hands-on demo to visitors."
"Modern online games are played using an Internet connection; some have dedicated client programs, while others require only a web browser."
 Some simpler browser games appeal to more casual gaming demographic groups (notably older audiences) that otherwise play very few video games.
"Role-playing games, often abbreviated as RPGs, are a type of game in which the participants (usually) assume the roles of characters acting in a fictional setting."
" The original role playing games – or at least those explicitly marketed as such – are played with a handful of participants, usually face-to-face, and keep track of the developing fiction with pen and paper."
" Together, the players may collaborate on a story involving those characters; create, develop, and ""explore"" the setting; or vicariously experience an adventure outside the bounds of everyday life."
" Pen-and-paper role-playing games include, for example, Dungeons & Dragons and GURPS."
The term role-playing game has also been appropriated by the video game industry to describe a genre of video games.
" These may be single-player games where one player experiences a programmed environment and story, or they may allow players to interact through the internet."
 The experience is usually quite different from traditional role-playing games.
" Single-player games include Final Fantasy, Fable, The Elder Scrolls, and Mass Effect."
" Online multi-player games, often referred to as Massively Multiplayer Online role playing games, or MMORPGs, include RuneScape, EverQuest 2, Guild Wars, MapleStory, Anarchy Online, and Dofus."
" As of 2009, the most successful MMORPG has been World of Warcraft, which controls the vast majority of the market."
"Business games can take a variety of forms, from interactive board games to interactive games involving different props (balls, ropes, hoops, etc."
 The purpose of these games is to link to some aspect of organizational performance and to generate discussions about business improvement.
 Some of these are computer simulations while others are simple designs for play and debriefing.
"The term ""game"" can include simulation or re-enactment of various activities or use in ""real life"" for various purposes: e."
" The root of this meaning may originate in the human prehistory of games deduced by anthropology from observing primitive cultures, in which children's games mimic the activities of adults to a significant degree: hunting, warring, nursing, etc."
