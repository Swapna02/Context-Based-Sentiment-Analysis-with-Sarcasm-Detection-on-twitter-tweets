"Terrorism is, in the broadest sense, the use of intentional violence to achieve political aims."
 It is used in this regard primarily to refer to violence during peacetime or in the context of war against non-combatants (mostly civilians and neutral military personnel).
" The terms ""terrorist"" and ""terrorism"" originated during the French Revolution of the late 18th century but became widely used internationally and gained worldwide attention in the 1970s during the conflicts of Northern Ireland, the Basque Country, and the Israeli–Palestinian conflict."
" The increased use of suicide attacks from the 1980s onwards was typified by the September 11 attacks in New York City, Arlington and Pennsylvania in 2001."
"There are various different definitions of terrorism, with no universal agreement about it."
" It is often used with the connotation of something that is ""morally wrong""."
 Governments and non-state groups use the term to abuse or denounce opposing groups.
 Varied political organizations have been accused of using terrorism to achieve their objectives.
" These include right-wing and left-wing political organizations, nationalist groups, religious groups, revolutionaries and ruling governments."
 Legislation declaring terrorism a crime has been adopted in many states.
" When terrorism is perpetrated by nation states, it is not considered terrorism by the state conducting it, making legality a largely grey-area issue."
 There is no consensus as to whether terrorism should be regarded as a war crime.
"The Global Terrorism Database, maintained by the University of Maryland, College Park, has recorded more than 61,000 incidents of non-state terrorism, resulting in at least 140,000 deaths, between 2000 and 2014."
"Etymologically, the word terror is derived from the Latin verb Tersere, which later becomes Terrere."
 The latter form appears in European languages as early as the 12th century; its first known use in French is the word terrible in 1160.
" Terreur is the origin of the Middle English term terrour, which later becomes the modern word ""terror""."
"The term terroriste, meaning ""terrorist"", is first used in 1794 by the French philosopher François-Noël Babeuf, who denounces Maximilien Robespierre's Jacobin regime as a dictatorship."
" In the years leading up to what became known as the Reign of Terror, the Brunswick Manifesto threatened Paris with an ""exemplary, never to be forgotten vengeance: the city would be subjected to military punishment and total destruction"" if the royal family was harmed, but this only increased the Revolution's will to abolish the monarchy."
 Some writers attitudes about French Revolution grew less favorable after the French monarchy was abolished in 1792.
" During the Reign of Terror, which began in July 1793 and lasted thirteen months, Paris was governed by the Committee of Public safety who oversaw a regime of mass executions and public purges."
"Prior to the French Revolution, ancient philosophers wrote about tyrannicide, as tyranny was seen as the greatest political threat to Greco-Roman civilization."
" Medieval philosophers were similarly occupied with the concept of tyranny, though the analysis of some theologians like Thomas Aquinas drew a distinction between usurpers, who could be killed by anyone, and legitimate rulers who abused their power—the latter, in Aquinas' view, could only be punished by a public authority."
 John of Salisbury was the first medieval Christian scholar to defend tyrannicide.
Most scholars today trace the origins of the modern tactic of terrorism to the Jewish Sicarii Zealots who attacked Romans and Jews in 1st-century Palestine.
 They follow its development from the Persian Order of Assassins through to 19th-century anarchists.
" The ""Reign of Terror"" is usually regarded as an issue of etymology."
 The term terrorism has generally been used to describe violence by non-state actors rather than government violence since the 19th-century Anarchist Movement.
"In December 1795, Edmund Burke used the word ""Terrorists"" in a description of the new French government called 'Directory':
"
"At length, after a terrible struggle, the [Directory] Troops prevailed over the Citizens ."
" To secure them further, they have a strong corps of irregulars, ready armed."
" Thousands of those Hell-hounds called Terrorists, whom they had shut up in Prison on their last Revolution, as the Satellites of Tyranny, are let loose on the people."
"The terms ""terrorism"" and ""terrorist"" gained renewed currency in the 1970s as a result of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the Northern Ireland conflict, the Basque conflict, and the operations of groups such as the Red Army Faction."
 Leila Khaled was described as a terrorist in a 1970 issue of Life magazine.
 A number of books on terrorism were published in the 1970s.
 The topic came further to the fore after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and again after the 2001 September 11 attacks and the 2002 Bali bombings.
In 2006 it was estimated that there were over 109 different definitions of terrorism.
" American political philosopher Michael Walzer in 2002 wrote: ""Terrorism is the deliberate killing of innocent people, at random, to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders""."
" Bruce Hoffman, an American scholar, has noted that it is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism."
 Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus.
" Coady has written that the question of how to define terrorism is ""irresolvable"" because ""its natural home is in polemical, ideological and propagandist contexts""."
"Experts disagree about ""whether terrorism is wrong by definition or just wrong as a matter of fact; they disagree about whether terrorism should be defined in terms of its aims, or its methods, or both, or neither; they disagree about whether states can perpetrate terrorism; they even disagree about the importance or otherwise of terror for a definition of terrorism."
State terrorism refers to acts of terrorism conducted by a state against its own citizens or against another state.
"In November 2004, a Secretary-General of the United Nations report described terrorism as any act ""intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act""."
" The international community has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime."
" These difficulties arise from the fact that the term ""terrorism"" is politically and emotionally charged."
" In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian parliament, stated,
"
The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism.
" During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination."
"These divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism."
 The international community has adopted a series of sectoral conventions that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities.
"Since 1994, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism:
"
"Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them."
Various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions of terrorism in their national legislation.
" Code Title 22 Chapter 38, Section 2656f(d) defines terrorism as:
"
"""Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents""."
" § 2331 defines ""international terrorism"" and ""domestic terrorism"" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code, entitled ""Terrorism"":
"
"""International terrorism"" means activities with the following three characteristics:
"
"Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
"
"Appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
"
occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.
", or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum."
A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the George C.
" Marshall European Center for Security Studies, underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:
"
Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols).
 Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization.
 The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience(s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states.
"Terrorists attack national symbols, which may negatively affect a government, while increasing the prestige of the given terrorist group or its ideology."
" Some official, governmental definitions of terrorism use the criterion of the illegitimacy or unlawfulness of the act."
" to distinguish between actions authorized by a government (and thus ""lawful"") and those of other actors, including individuals and small groups."
" For example, carrying out a strategic bombing on an enemy city, which is designed to affect civilian support for a cause, would not be considered terrorism if it were authorized by a government."
" This criterion is inherently problematic and is not universally accepted, because: it denies the existence of state terrorism."
"According to Ali Khan, the distinction lies ultimately in a political judgment."
"Having the moral charge in our vocabulary of 'something morally wrong', the term 'terrorism' is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties, either governments or non-state groups."
"Those labeled ""terrorists"" by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such, and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation, such as separatist, freedom fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, patriot, or any similar-meaning word in other languages and cultures."
" Jihadi, mujahideen, and fedayeen are similar Arabic words that have entered the English lexicon."
 It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists.
"On whether particular terrorist acts, such as killing non-combatants, can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance, philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin, utilitarian philosophers can (in theory) conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good that could not be achieved in a less morally costly way, in practice the ""harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism""."
" Among the non-utilitarian philosophers, Michael Walzer argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when ""a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so""."
"In his book Inside Terrorism Bruce Hoffman offered an explanation of why the term terrorism becomes distorted:
"
"On one point, at least, everyone agrees: terrorism is a pejorative term."
" It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore."
" 'What is called terrorism,' Brian Jenkins has written, 'thus seems to depend on one's point of view."
" Use of the term implies a moral judgment; and if one party can successfully attach the label terrorist to its opponent, then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint."
"' Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization terrorist becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned."
" If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism."
" If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism."
"The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the aphorism, ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter""."
" This is exemplified when a group using irregular military methods is an ally of a state against a mutual enemy, but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally."
" During the Second World War, the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army were allied with the British, but during the Malayan Emergency, members of its successor organisation (the Malayan Races Liberation Army) started campaigns against them, and were branded ""terrorists"" as a result."
" More recently, Ronald Reagan and others in the American administration frequently called the mujaheddin ""freedom fighters"" during the Soviet–Afghan War yet twenty years later, when a new generation of Afghan men were fighting against what they perceive to be a regime installed by foreign powers, their attacks were labelled ""terrorism"" by George W."
 Groups accused of terrorism understandably prefer terms reflecting legitimate military or ideological action.
" Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner, director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawa's Carleton University, defines ""terrorist acts"" as unlawful attacks for political or other ideological goals, and said:
"
There is the famous statement: 'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.
 It assesses the validity of the cause when terrorism is an act.
" One can have a perfectly beautiful cause and yet if one commits terrorist acts, it is terrorism regardless."
"Some groups, when involved in a ""liberation"" struggle, have been called ""terrorists"" by the Western governments or media."
" Later, these same persons, as leaders of the liberated nations, are called ""statesmen"" by similar organizations."
 Two examples of this phenomenon are the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Menachem Begin and Nelson Mandela.
" WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange has been called a ""terrorist"" by Sarah Palin and Joe Biden."
"Sometimes, states that are close allies, for reasons of history, culture and politics, can disagree over whether members of a certain organization are terrorists."
" For instance, for many years, some branches of the United States government refused to label members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) as terrorists while the IRA was using methods against one of the United States' closest allies (the United Kingdom) that the UK branded as terrorism."
"Media outlets who wish to convey impartiality may limit their usage of ""terrorist"" and ""terrorism"" because they are loosely defined, potentially controversial in nature, and subjective terms."
"Depending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st century AD."
" Sicarii Zealots, though some dispute whether the group, a radical offshoot of the Zealots which was active in Judaea Province at the beginning of the 1st century AD, was in fact terrorist."
" According to the contemporary Jewish-Roman historian Josephus, after the Zealotry rebellion against Roman rule in Judea, when some prominent Jewish collaborators with Roman rule were killed, Judas of Galilee formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the Sicarii, in 6 AD."
" Their terror was directed against Jewish ""collaborators"", including temple priests, Sadducees, Herodians, and other wealthy elites."
"The term ""terrorism"" itself was originally used to describe the actions of the Jacobin Club during the ""Reign of Terror"" in the French Revolution."
" ""Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible"", said Jacobin leader Maximilien Robespierre."
" In 1795, Edmund Burke denounced the Jacobins for letting ""thousands of those hell-hounds called Terrorists ."
"In January 1858, Italian patriot Felice Orsini threw three bombs in an attempt to assassinate French Emperor Napoleon III."
 The incident played a crucial role as an inspiration for the development of the early terrorist groups.
"Arguably the first organization to utilize modern terrorist techniques was the Irish Republican Brotherhood, founded in 1858 as a revolutionary Irish nationalist group that carried out attacks in England."
" The group initiated the Fenian dynamite campaign in 1881, one of the first modern terror campaigns."
" Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination, this campaign used timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain, in order to achieve political gains."
"Another early terrorist group was Narodnaya Volya, founded in Russia in 1878 as a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by Sergei Nechayev and ""propaganda by the deed"" theorist Carlo Pisacane."
" The group developed ideas—such as targeted killing of the 'leaders of oppression'—that were to become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age—such as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of—enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination."
"David Rapoport refers to four major waves of global terrorism: ""the Anarchist, the Anti-Colonial, the New Left, and the Religious."
 The first three have been completed and lasted around 40 years; the fourth is now in its third decade.
"Depending on the country, the political system, and the time in history, the types of terrorism are varying."
"In early 1975, the Law Enforcement Assistant Administration in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals."
" One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled Disorders and Terrorism, produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H."
"The Task Force defines terrorism as ""a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes""."
" It classified disorders and terrorism into six categories:
"
"Civil disorder – A form of collective violence interfering with the peace, security, and normal functioning of the community."
"Political terrorism – Violent criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate fear in the community, or substantial segment of it, for political purposes."
"Non-Political terrorism – Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes but which exhibits ""conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for coercive purposes, but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective""."
"Anonymous terrorism – In the two decades prior to 2016-19, ""fewer than half"" of all terrorist attacks were either ""claimed by their perpetrators or convincingly attributed by governments to specific terrorist groups""."
 A number of theory have been advanced as to why this has happened.
Quasi-terrorism – The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient.
" It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism, but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction."
" For example, the fleeing felon who takes hostages is a quasi-terrorist, whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different."
"Limited political terrorism – Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a revolutionary approach; limited political terrorism refers to ""acts of terrorism which are committed for ideological or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the state""."
"Official or state terrorism – ""referring to nations whose rule is based upon fear and oppression that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions""."
" It may be referred to as Structural Terrorism defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives, often as part of their foreign policy."
"Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways, for example, broadly classifying it into domestic terrorism and international terrorism, or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism."
"Individuals and groups choose terrorism as a tactic because it can:
"
"Act as a form of asymmetric warfare in order to directly force a government to agree to demands
"
"Intimidate a group of people into capitulating to the demands in order to avoid future injury
"
"Directly inspire more people to the cause (such as revolutionary acts) – propaganda of the deed
"
"Indirectly inspire more people to the cause by provoking a hostile response or over-reaction from enemies to the causeAttacks on ""collaborators"" are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control."
" This strategy was used in Ireland, in Kenya, in Algeria and in Cyprus during their independence struggles."
Stated motives for the September 11 attacks included inspiring more fighters to join the cause of repelling the United States from Muslim countries with a successful high-profile attack.
 The attacks prompted some criticism from domestic and international observers regarding perceived injustices in U.
" foreign policy that provoked the attacks, but the larger practical effect was that the United States government declared a War on Terror that resulted in substantial military engagements in several Muslim-majority countries."
" Various commentators have inferred that al-Qaeda expected a military response, and welcomed it as a provocation that would result in more Muslims fight the United States."
 Some commentators believe that the resulting anger and suspicion directed toward innocent Muslims living in Western countries and the indignities inflicted upon them by security forces and the general public also contributes to radicalization of new recruits.
" Despite criticism that the Iraqi government had no involvement with the September 11 attacks, Bush declared the 2003 invasion of Iraq to be part of the War on Terror."
" The resulting backlash and instability enabled the rise of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the temporary creation of an Islamic caliphate holding territory in Iraq and Syria, until ISIL lost its territory through military defeats."
Attacks used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported have included the Palestinian airplane hijackings in 1970 and the 1975 Dutch train hostage crisis.
"Adoption of a particular political philosophy, such as socialism (left-wing terrorism), anarchism, or fascism (possibly through a coup or as an ideology of an independence or separatist movement)
"
"Preventing a rival group from sharing or occupying a particular territory (such as by discouraging immigration or encouraging flight)
"
"Subjugation of a particular population (such as lynching of African Americans)
"
"Spread or dominance of a particular religion – religious terrorism
"
"Responding to a violent act (for example, tit-for-tat attacks in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in The Troubles in Northern Ireland, or Timothy McVeigh's revenge for the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge incident)Causes for right-wing terrorism have included white nationalism, ethnonationalism, fascism, anti-socialism, the anti-abortion movement, and tax resistance."
Sometimes terrorists on the same side fight for different reasons.
" For example, in the Chechen–Russian conflict secular Chechens using terrorist tactics fighting for national independence are allied with radical Islamist terrorists who have arrived from other countries."
"Various personal and social factors may influence the personal choice of whether to join a terrorist group or attempt an act of terror, including:
"
"Identity, including affiliation with a particular culture, ethnicity, or religion
"
"Financial reward (for example, the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund)
"
"Perception that the cause responds to a profound injustice or indignityA report conducted by Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert found that for ""lone wolf"" terrorists:
"
"32% had pre-existing mental health disorders, while many more are found to have mental health problems upon arrest
"
"At least 37% lived alone at the time of their event planning and/or execution, a further 26% lived with others, and no data were available for the remaining cases
"
"40% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event
"
"14% percent experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assaultAriel Merari, a psychologist who has studied the psychological profiles of suicide terrorists since 1983 through media reports that contained biographical details, interviews with the suicides' families, and interviews with jailed would-be suicide attackers, concluded that they were unlikely to be psychologically abnormal."
" In comparison to economic theories of criminal behaviour, Scott Atran found that suicide terrorists exhibit none of the socially dysfunctional attributes—such as fatherless, friendless, jobless situations—or suicidal symptoms."
" By which he means, they do not kill themselves simply out of hopelessness or a sense of 'having nothing to lose'."
Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness.
" Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives, which are often murky and undefined."
Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism.
"Terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom, and it is least common in the most democratic nations."
"Some examples of ""terrorism"" in non-democratic nations include ETA in Spain under Francisco Franco (although the group's terrorist activities increased sharply after Franco's death), the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in pre-war Poland, the Shining Path in Peru under Alberto Fujimori, the Kurdistan Workers Party when Turkey was ruled by military leaders and the ANC in South Africa."
" Democracies, such as Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel, Indonesia, India, Spain, Germany, Italy and the Philippines, have experienced domestic terrorism."
"While a democratic nation espousing civil liberties may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties."
" For this reason, homegrown terrorism has started to be seen as a greater threat, as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden."
" This dilemma, some social theorists would conclude, may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist(s); namely, to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system."
"According to the Global Terrorism Index by the University of Maryland, College Park, religious extremism has overtaken national separatism and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world."
 Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks.
 The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda.
" Before 2000, it was nationalist separatist terrorist organizations such as the IRA and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks."
 The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown.
" The prevalence of Islamist groups in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria is the main driver behind these trends."
"Four of the terrorist groups that have been most active since 2001 are Boko Haram, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and ISIL."
" These groups have been most active in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria."
 Eighty percent of all deaths from terrorism occurred in one of these five countries.
" In 2015 four Islamic extremist groups were responsible for 74% of all deaths from Islamic terrorism: ISIS, Boko Haram, the Taliban, and al-Qaeda, according to the Global Terrorism Index 2016."
" Since approximately 2000, these incidents have occurred on a global scale, affecting not only Muslim-majority states in Africa and Asia, but also states with non-Muslim majority such as United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Belgium, Sweden, Russia, Australia, Canada, Sri Lanka, Israel, China, India and Philippines."
" Such attacks have targeted both Muslims and non-Muslims, however the majority affect Muslims themselves."
" From the summer of 2007 until late 2009, more than 1,500 people were killed in suicide and other attacks on civilians for reasons attributed to a number of causes—sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims; easy availability of guns and explosives; the existence of a ""Kalashnikov culture""; an influx of ideologically driven Muslims based in or near Pakistan, who originated from various nations around the world and the subsequent war against the pro-Soviet Afghans in the 1980s which blew back into Pakistan; the presence of Islamist insurgent groups and forces such as the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba."
" On July 2, 2013 in Lahore, 50 Muslim scholars of the Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) issued a collective fatwa against suicide bombings, the killing of innocent people, bomb attacks, and targeted killings declaring them as Haraam or forbidden."
"In 2015, the Southern Poverty Law Center released a report on terrorism in the United States."
" The report (titled The Age of the Wolf) found that during that period, ""more people have been killed in America by non-Islamic domestic terrorists than jihadists."
""" The ""virulent racist and anti-semitic"" ideology of the ultra-right wing Christian Identity movement is usually accompanied by anti-government sentiments."
" Adherents of Christian Identity are not connected with specific Christian denominations, and they believe that whites of European descent can be traced back to the ""Lost Tribes of Israel"" and many consider Jews to be the Satanic offspring of Eve and the Serpent."
" This group has committed hate crimes, bombings and other acts of terrorism."
 Its influence ranges from the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazi groups to the anti-government militia and sovereign citizen movements.
" Christian Identity's origins can be traced back to Anglo-Israelism, which held the view that the British people were descendants of ancient Israelites."
" However, in the United States, the ideology started to become rife with anti-Semitism, and eventually Christian Identity theology diverged from the philo-semitic Anglo-Israelism, and developed what is known as the ""two seed"" theory."
" According to the two-seed theory, the Jewish people are descended from Cain and the serpent (not from Shem)."
" The white European seedline is descended from the ""lost tribes"" of Israel."
" They hold themselves to ""God's laws"", not to ""man's laws"", and they do not feel bound to a government that they consider run by Jews and the New World Order."
 The Ku Klux Klan is widely denounced by Christian denominations.
Israel has had problems with Jewish religious terrorism even before independence in 1948.
" During British mandate over Palestine, the Irgun were among the Zionist groups labelled as terrorist organisations by the British authorities and United Nations, for violent terror attacks against Britons and Arabs."
" Another extremist group, the Lehi, openly declared its members as ""terrorists""."
" Historian William Cleveland stated many Jews justified any action, even terrorism, taken in the cause of the creation of a Jewish state."
" In 1995, Yigal Amir assassinated Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin."
" For Amir, killing Rabin was an exemplary act that symbolized the fight against an illegitimate government that was prepared to cede Jewish Holy Land to the Palestinians."
"The perpetrators of acts of terrorism can be individuals, groups, or states."
" According to some definitions, clandestine or semi-clandestine state actors may carry out terrorist acts outside the framework of a state of war."
" The most common image of terrorism is that it is carried out by small and secretive cells, highly motivated to serve a particular cause and many of the most deadly operations in recent times, such as the September 11 attacks, the London underground bombing, 2008 Mumbai attacks and the 2002 Bali bombing were planned and carried out by a close clique, composed of close friends, family members and other strong social networks."
 These groups benefited from the free flow of information and efficient telecommunications to succeed where others had failed.
"Over the years, much research has been conducted to distill a terrorist profile to explain these individuals' actions through their psychology and socio-economic circumstances."
" Others, like Roderick Hindery, have sought to discern profiles in the propaganda tactics used by terrorists."
 Some security organizations designate these groups as violent non-state actors.
 Krueger found that terrorists were less likely to come from an impoverished background (28 percent versus 33 percent) and more likely to have at least a high-school education (47 percent versus 38 percent).
" Another analysis found only 16 percent of terrorists came from impoverished families, versus 30 percent of male Palestinians, and over 60 percent had gone beyond high school, versus 15 percent of the populace."
"A study into the poverty-stricken conditions and whether terrorists are more likely to come from here,show that people who grew up in these situations tend to show aggression and frustration towards others."
" This theory is largely debated for the simple fact that just because one is frustrated,does not make them a potential terrorist."
"To avoid detection, a terrorist will look, dress, and behave normally until executing the assigned mission."
" Some claim that attempts to profile terrorists based on personality, physical, or sociological traits are not useful."
 The physical and behavioral description of the terrorist could describe almost any normal person.
" the majority of terrorist attacks are carried out by military age men, aged 16 to 40."
"Groups not part of the state apparatus of in opposition to the state are most commonly referred to as a ""terrorist"" in the media."
"According to the Global Terrorism Database, the most active terrorist group in the period 1970 to 2010 was Shining Path (with 4,517 attacks), followed by Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), Irish Republican Army (IRA), Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA), Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), Taliban, Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, New People's Army, National Liberation Army of Colombia (ELN), and Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK)."
A state can sponsor terrorism by funding or harboring a terrorist group.
 Opinions as to which acts of violence by states consist of state-sponsored terrorism vary widely.
" When states provide funding for groups considered by some to be terrorist, they rarely acknowledge them as such."
Civilization is based on a clearly defined and widely accepted yet often unarticulated hierarchy.
" Violence done by those higher on the hierarchy to those lower is nearly always invisible, that is, unnoticed."
" Violence done by those lower on the hierarchy to those higher is unthinkable, and when it does occur it is regarded with shock, horror, and the fetishization of the victims."
"As with ""terrorism"" the concept of ""state terrorism"" is controversial."
" The Chairman of the United Nations Counter-Terrorism Committee has stated that the committee was conscious of 12 international conventions on the subject, and none of them referred to state terrorism, which was not an international legal concept."
" If states abused their power, they should be judged against international conventions dealing with war crimes, international human rights law, and international humanitarian law."
" Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that it is ""time to set aside debates on so-called 'state terrorism'."
" The use of force by states is already thoroughly regulated under international law""."
" he made clear that, ""regardless of the differences between governments on the question of the definition of terrorism, what is clear and what we can all agree on is that any deliberate attack on innocent civilians [or non-combatants], regardless of one's cause, is unacceptable and fits into the definition of terrorism."
State terrorism has been used to refer to terrorist acts committed by governmental agents or forces.
" This involves the use of state resources employed by a state's foreign policies, such as using its military to directly perform acts of terrorism."
" Professor of Political Science Michael Stohl cites the examples that include the German bombing of London, the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Allied firebombing of Dresden, and the U."
 atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II.
" He argues that ""the use of terror tactics is common in international relations and the state has been and remains a more likely employer of terrorism within the international system than insurgents."
""" He cites the first strike option as an example of the ""terror of coercive diplomacy"" as a form of this, which holds the world hostage with the implied threat of using nuclear weapons in ""crisis management"" and he argues that the institutionalized form of terrorism has occurred as a result of changes that took place following World War II."
" In this analysis, state terrorism exhibited as a form of foreign policy was shaped by the presence and use of weapons of mass destruction, and the legitimizing of such violent behavior led to an increasingly accepted form of this behavior by the state."
" Charles Stewart Parnell described William Ewart Gladstone's Irish Coercion Act as terrorism in his ""no-Rent manifesto"" in 1881, during the Irish Land War."
 The concept is used to describe political repressions by governments against their own civilian populations with the purpose of inciting fear.
" For example, taking and executing civilian hostages or extrajudicial elimination campaigns are commonly considered ""terror"" or terrorism, for example during the Red Terror or the Great Terror."
" Such actions are often described as democide or genocide, which have been argued to be equivalent to state terrorism."
 Empirical studies on this have found that democracies have little democide.
" Western democracies, including the United States, have supported state terrorism and mass killings, with some examples being the Indonesian mass killings of 1965–66 and Operation Condor."
The connection between terrorism and tourism has been widely studied since the Luxor massacre in Egypt.
" In the 1970s, the targets of terrorists were politicians and chiefs of police while now, international tourists and visitors are selected as the main targets of attacks."
" The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, were the symbolic center, which marked a new epoch in the use of civil transport against the main power of the planet."
" From this event onwards, the spaces of leisure that characterized the pride of West, were conceived as dangerous and frightful."
"State sponsors have constituted a major form of funding; for example, Palestine Liberation Organization, Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine and other groups considered to be terrorist organizations, were funded by the Soviet Union."
 The Stern Gang received funding from Italian Fascist officers in Beirut to undermine the British authorities in Palestine.
"""Revolutionary tax"" is another major form of funding, and essentially a euphemism for ""protection money""."
" Revolutionary taxes ""play a secondary role as one other means of intimidating the target population""."
"Other major sources of funding include kidnapping for ransoms, smuggling (including wildlife smuggling), fraud, and robbery."
" The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant has reportedly received funding ""via private donations from the Gulf states""."
"The Financial Action Task Force is an inter-governmental body whose mandate, since October 2001, has included combating terrorist financing."
"Terrorist attacks are often targeted to maximize fear and publicity, most frequently using explosives."
"Terrorist groups usually methodically plan attacks in advance, and may train participants, plant undercover agents, and raise money from supporters or through organized crime."
" Communications occur through modern telecommunications, or through old-fashioned methods such as couriers."
 There is concern about terrorist attacks employing weapons of mass destruction.
" Some academics have argued that while it is often assumed terrorism is intended to spread fear, this is not necessarily true, with fear instead being a by-product of the terrorist's actions, while their intentions may be to avenge fallen comrades or destroy their perceived enemies."
"Terrorism is a form of asymmetric warfare, and is more common when direct conventional warfare will not be effective because opposing forces vary greatly in power."
 Yuval Harari argues that the peacefulness of modern states makes them paradoxically more vulnerable to terrorism than pre-modern states.
" Harari argues that because modern states have committed themselves to reducing political violence to almost zero, terrorists can, by creating political violence, threaten the very foundations of the legitimacy of the modern state."
" This is in contrast to pre-modern states, where violence was a routine and recognised aspect of politics at all levels, making political violence unremarkable."
" Terrorism thus shocks the population of a modern state far more than a pre-modern one and consequently the state is forced to overreact in an excessive, costly and spectacular manner, which is often what the terrorists desire."
The type of people terrorists will target is dependent upon the ideology of the terrorists.
" A terrorist's ideology will create a class of ""legitimate targets"" who are deemed as its enemies and who are permitted to be targeted."
" This ideology will also allow the terrorists to place the blame on the victim, who is viewed as being responsible for the violence in the first place."
"The context in which terrorist tactics are used is often a large-scale, unresolved political conflict."
" The type of conflict varies widely; historical examples include:
"
"Secession of a territory to form a new sovereign state or become part of a different state
"
"Dominance of territory or resources by various ethnic groups
"
 They can include re-alignments of the political spectrum and reassessments of fundamental values.
"Targeted laws, criminal procedures, deportations, and enhanced police powers
"
"Target hardening, such as locking doors or adding traffic barriers
"
"More permissive interrogation and detention policiesThe term ""counter-terrorism"" has a narrower connotation, implying that it is directed at terrorist actors."
"Terrorism research, also called terrorism studies, or terrorism and counter-terrorism research, is an interdisciplinary academic field which seeks to understand the causes of terrorism, how to prevent it as well as its impact in the broadest sense."
" Terrorism research can be carried out in both military and civilian contexts, for example by research centres such as the British Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence, the Norwegian Centre for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies, and the International Centre for Counter-Terrorism (ICCT)."
" There are several academic journals devoted to the field, including Perspectives on Terrorism."
One of the agreements that promote the international legal anti-terror framework is the Code of Conduct Towards Achieving a World Free of Terrorism that was adopted at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2018.
 The Code of Conduct was initiated by Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
 Its main goal is to implement a wide range of international commitments to counter terrorism and establish a broad global coalition towards achieving a world free of terrorism by 2045.
" Arkin in The Washington Post, ""Some 1,271 government organizations and 1,931 private companies work on programs related to counterterrorism, homeland security and intelligence in about 10,000 locations across the United States."
"""America's thinking on how to defeat radical Islamists is split along two very different schools of thought."
" Republicans, typically follow what is known as the Bush Doctrine, advocate the military model of taking the fight to the enemy and seeking to democratize the Middle East."
" Democrats, by contrast, generally propose the law enforcement model of better cooperation with nations and more security at home."
" Army / Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Field Manual, Sarah Sewall states the need for ""U."
" forces to make securing the civilian, rather than destroying the enemy, their top priority."
 The civilian population is the center of gravity—the deciding factor in the struggle.
 Civilian deaths create an extended family of enemies—new insurgent recruits or informants—and erode support of the host nation.
""" Sewall sums up the book's key points on how to win this battle: ""Sometimes, the more you protect your force, the less secure you may be."
" Sometimes, the more force is used, the less effective it is."
" The more successful the counterinsurgency is, the less force can be used and the more risk must be accepted."
""" This strategy, often termed ""courageous restraint"", has certainly led to some success on the Middle East battlefield."
" However, it does not address the fact that terrorists are mostly homegrown."
"Mass media exposure may be a primary goal of those carrying out terrorism, to expose issues that would otherwise be ignored by the media."
 Some consider this to be manipulation and exploitation of the media.
The Internet has created a new channel for groups to spread their messages.
 This has created a cycle of measures and counter measures by groups in support of and in opposition to terrorist movements.
 The United Nations has created its own online counter-terrorism resource.
"The mass media will, on occasion, censor organizations involved in terrorism (through self-restraint or regulation) to discourage further terrorism."
 This may encourage organizations to perform more extreme acts of terrorism to be shown in the mass media.
" Pastor explains the significant relationship between terrorism and the media, and the underlying benefit each receives from the other."
There is always a point at which the terrorist ceases to manipulate the media gestalt.
" A point at which the violence may well escalate, but beyond which the terrorist has become symptomatic of the media gestalt itself."
 Terrorism as we ordinarily understand it is innately media-related.
"Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher famously spoke of the close connection between terrorism and the media, calling publicity 'the oxygen of terrorism'."
Jones and Libicki (2008) created a list of all the terrorist groups they could find that were active between 1968 and 2006.
" Of those, 136 splintered and 244 were still active in 2006."
" Of the ones that ended, 43 percent converted to nonviolent political actions, like the Irish Republican Army in Northern Ireland."
" Only 20 groups, 7 percent, were destroyed by military force."
Forty-two groups became large enough to be labeled an insurgency; 38 of those had ended by 2006.
" Of those, 47 percent converted to nonviolent political actors."
" Jones and Libicki concluded that military force may be necessary to deal with large insurgencies but are only occasionally decisive, because the military is too often seen as a bigger threat to civilians than the terrorists."
" To avoid that, the rules of engagement must be conscious of collateral damage and work to minimize it."
"Another researcher, Audrey Cronin, lists six primary ways that terrorist groups end:
"
"The following terrorism databases are or were made publicly available for research purposes, and track specific acts of terrorism:

"War is an intense armed conflict between states, governments, societies, or paramilitary groups such as mercenaries, insurgents, and militias."
" It is generally characterized by extreme violence, aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces."
" Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general."
" Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant suffering and casualties."
"While some war studies scholars consider war a universal and ancestral aspect of human nature, others argue it is a result of specific socio-cultural, economic or ecological circumstances."
"The English word war derives from the 11th-century Old English words wyrre and werre, from Old French werre (also guerre as in modern French), in turn from the Frankish *werra, ultimately deriving from the Proto-Germanic *werzō 'mixture, confusion'."
" The word is related to the Old Saxon werran, Old High German werran, and the German verwirren, meaning ""to confuse"", ""to perplex"", and ""to bring into confusion""."
"The earliest evidence of prehistoric warfare is a Mesolithic cemetery in Jebel Sahaba, which has been determined to be approximately 14,000 years old."
 About forty-five percent of the skeletons there displayed signs of violent death.
" Since the rise of the state some 5,000 years ago, military activity has occurred over much of the globe."
 The advent of gunpowder and the acceleration of technological advances led to modern warfare.
" Henderson, ""One source claims that 14,500 wars have taken place between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, costing 3."
"5 billion lives, leaving only 300 years of peace (Beer 1981: 20)."
""" An unfavorable review of this estimate mentions the following regarding one of the proponents of this estimate: ""In addition, perhaps feeling that the war casualties figure was improbably high, he changed 'approximately 3,640,000,000 human beings have been killed by war or the diseases produced by war' to 'approximately 1,240,000,000 human beings."
"'"" The lower figure is more plausible, but could still be on the high side considering that the 100 deadliest acts of mass violence between 480 BC and 2002 AD (wars and other man-made disasters with at least 300,000 and up to 66 million victims) claimed about 455 million human lives in total."
" Added to the aforementioned  figure of 1,240 million between 3500 BC and the late 20th century, this would mean a total of 1,640,000,000 people killed by war (including deaths from famine and disease caused by war) throughout the history and pre-history of mankind."
" For comparison, an estimated 1,680,000,000 people died from infectious diseases in the 20th century."
" Keeley, a professor at the University of Illinois, says approximately 90–95% of known societies throughout history engaged in at least occasional warfare, and many fought constantly."
"Keeley describes several styles of primitive combat such as small raids, large raids, and massacres."
" All of these forms of warfare were used by primitive societies, a finding supported by other researchers."
" Keeley explains that early war raids were not well organized, as the participants did not have any formal training."
 Scarcity of resources meant defensive works were not a cost-effective way to protect the society against enemy raids.
"William Rubinstein wrote ""Pre-literate societies, even those organised in a relatively advanced way, were renowned for their studied cruelty."
'archaeology yields evidence of prehistoric massacres more severe than any recounted in ethnography [i.
"In Western Europe, since the late 18th century, more than 150 conflicts and about 600 battles have taken place."
" During the 20th century, war resulted in a dramatic intensification of the pace of social changes, and was a crucial catalyst for the emergence of the political Left as a force to be reckoned with."
"In 1947, in view of the rapidly increasingly destructive consequences of modern warfare, and with a particular concern for the consequences and costs of the newly developed atom bomb, Albert Einstein famously stated, ""I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones."
"""Mao Zedong urged the socialist camp not to fear nuclear war with the United States since, even if ""half of mankind died, the other half would remain while imperialism would be razed to the ground and the whole world would become socialist."
"""A distinctive feature of war since 1945 is the absence of wars between major powers—indeed the near absence of any traditional wars between established countries."
" The major exceptions were the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the Iran–Iraq War 1980–1988, and the Gulf War of 1990–91."
"  Instead, combat has largely been a matter of civil wars and insurgencies."
The Human Security Report 2005 documented a significant decline in the number and severity of armed conflicts since the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s.
" However, the evidence examined in the 2008 edition of the Center for International Development and Conflict Management's ""Peace and Conflict"" study indicated the overall decline in conflicts had stalled."
Asymmetric warfare is a conflict between belligerents of drastically different levels of military capability or size.
"Biological warfare, or germ warfare, is the use of weaponized biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi."
Chemical warfare involves the use of weaponized chemicals in combat.
" Poison gas as a chemical weapon was principally used during World War I, and resulted in over a million estimated casualties, including more than 100,000 civilians."
"Cold warfare is an intense international rivalry without direct military conflict, but with a sustained threat of it, including high levels of military preparations, expenditures, and development, and may involve active conflicts by indirect means, such as economic warfare, political warfare, covert operations, espionage, cyberwarfare, or proxy wars."
"Conventional warfare is declared war between states in which nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons are not used or see limited deployment."
Cyberwarfare involves the actions by a nation-state or international organization to attack and attempt to damage another nation's information systems.
"Insurgency is a rebellion against authority, when those taking part in the rebellion are not recognized as belligerents (lawful combatants)."
" An insurgency can be fought via counter-insurgency warfare, and may also be opposed by measures to protect the population, and by political and economic actions of various kinds aimed at undermining the insurgents' claims against the incumbent regime."
"Information warfare is the application of destructive force on a large scale against information assets and systems, against the computers and networks that support the four critical infrastructures (the power grid, communications, financial, and transportation)."
"Nuclear warfare is warfare in which nuclear weapons are the primary, or a major, method of achieving capitulation."
"Total war is warfare by any means possible, disregarding the laws of war, placing no limits on legitimate military targets, using weapons and tactics resulting in significant civilian casualties, or demanding a war effort requiring significant sacrifices by the friendly civilian population."
"Unconventional warfare, the opposite of conventional warfare, is an attempt to achieve military victory through acquiescence, capitulation, or clandestine support for one side of an existing conflict."
Entities contemplating going to war and entities considering whether to end a war may formulate war aims as an evaluation/propaganda tool.
 War aims may stand as a proxy for national-military resolve.
"Fried defines war aims as ""the desired territorial, economic, military or other benefits expected following successful conclusion of a war""."
Tangible war aims may involve (for example) the acquisition of territory (as in the German goal of Lebensraum in the first half of the 20th century) or the recognition of economic concessions (as in the Anglo-Dutch Wars).
"Intangible war aims – like the accumulation of credibility or reputation – may have more tangible expression (""conquest restores prestige, annexation increases power"")."
"Implicit war aims can take the form of minutes of discussion, memoranda and instructions."
"""Negative war aims"" forestall or prevent undesired outcomes."
"War aims can change in the course of conflict and may eventually morph into ""peace conditions"" – the minimal conditions under which a state may cease to wage a particular war."
"=== Military and civilian casualties in recent human history ===
"
"Throughout the course of human history, the average number of people dying from war has fluctuated relatively little, being about 1 to 10 people dying per 100,000."
" However, major wars over shorter periods have resulted in much higher casualty rates, with 100-200 casualties per 100,000 over a few years."
" While conventional wisdom holds that casualties have increased in recent times due to technological improvements in warfare, this is not generally true."
" For instance, the Thirty Years' War (1618–1648) had about the same number of casualties per capita as World War I, although it was higher during World War II (WWII)."
" That said, overall the number of casualties from war has not significantly increased in recent times."
" Quite to the contrary, on a global scale the time since WWII has been unusually peaceful."
"The deadliest war in history, in terms of the cumulative number of deaths since its start, is World War II, from 1939 to 1945, with 60–85 million deaths, followed by the Mongol conquests at up to 60 million."
" As concerns a belligerent's losses in proportion to its prewar population, the most destructive war in modern history may have been the Paraguayan War (see Paraguayan War casualties)."
" In 2013 war resulted in 31,000 deaths, down from 72,000 deaths in 1990."
" In 2003, Richard Smalley identified war as the sixth biggest problem (of ten) facing humanity for the next fifty years."
" War usually results in significant deterioration of infrastructure and the ecosystem, a decrease in social spending, famine, large-scale emigration from the war zone, and often the mistreatment of prisoners of war or civilians."
" For instance, of the nine million people who were on the territory of the Byelorussian SSR in 1941, some 1."
"6 million were killed by the Germans in actions away from battlefields, including about 700,000 prisoners of war, 500,000 Jews, and 320,000 people counted as partisans (the vast majority of whom were unarmed civilians)."
" Another byproduct of some wars is the prevalence of propaganda by some or all parties in the conflict, and increased revenues by weapons manufacturers."
"Three of the ten most costly wars, in terms of loss of life, have been waged in the last century."
" These are the two World Wars, followed by the Second Sino-Japanese War (which is sometimes considered part of World War II, or as overlapping)."
" The death toll of World War II, being over 60 million, surpasses all other war-death-tolls."
"Military personnel subject to combat in war often suffer mental and physical injuries, including depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, disease, injury, and death."
"In every war in which American soldiers have fought in, the chances of becoming a psychiatric casualty – of being debilitated for some period of time as a consequence of the stresses of military life – were greater than the chances of being killed by enemy fire."
"During World War II, research conducted by US Army Brigadier General S."
" Marshall found, on average, 15% to 20% of American riflemen in WWII combat fired at the enemy."
" Lord notes that of the 27,574 discarded muskets found on the Gettysburg battlefield, nearly 90% were loaded, with 12,000 loaded more than once and 6,000 loaded 3 to 10 times."
" These studies suggest most military personnel resist firing their weapons in combat, that – as some theorists argue – human beings have an inherent resistance to killing their fellow human beings."
" Swank and Marchand's WWII study found that after sixty days of continuous combat, 98% of all surviving military personnel will become psychiatric casualties."
" Psychiatric casualties manifest themselves in fatigue cases, confusional states, conversion hysteria, anxiety, obsessional and compulsive states, and character disorders."
"One-tenth of mobilised American men were hospitalised for mental disturbances between 1942 and 1945, and after thirty-five days of uninterrupted combat, 98% of them manifested psychiatric disturbances in varying degrees."
"Additionally, it has been estimated anywhere from 18% to 54% of Vietnam war veterans suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder."
"Based on 1860 census figures, 8% of all white American males aged 13 to 43 died in the American Civil War, including about 6% in the North and approximately 18% in the South."
" The war remains the deadliest conflict in American history, resulting in the deaths of 620,000 military personnel."
 United States military casualties of war since 1775 have totaled over two million.
" Of the 60 million European military personnel who were mobilized in World War I, 8 million were killed, 7 million were permanently disabled, and 15 million were seriously injured."
"During Napoleon's retreat from Moscow, more French military personnel died of typhus than were killed by the Russians."
" Of the 450,000 soldiers who crossed the Neman on 25 June 1812, less than 40,000 returned."
 More military personnel were killed from 1500 to 1914 by typhus than from military action.
" In addition, if it were not for modern medical advances there would be thousands more dead from disease and infection."
" For instance, during the Seven Years' War, the Royal Navy reported it conscripted 184,899 sailors, of whom 133,708 (72%) died of disease or were 'missing'."
"It is estimated that between 1985 and 1994, 378,000 people per year died due to war."
"Most wars have resulted in significant loss of life, along with destruction of infrastructure and resources (which may lead to famine, disease, and death in the civilian population)."
" During the Thirty Years' War in Europe, the population of the Holy Roman Empire was reduced by 15 to 40 percent."
" Civilians in war zones may also be subject to war atrocities such as genocide, while survivors may suffer the psychological aftereffects of witnessing the destruction of war."
 War also results in lower quality of life and worse health outcomes.
" A medium-sized conflict with about 2,500 battle deaths reduces civilian life expectancy by one year and increases infant mortality by 10% and malnutrition by 3."
"Most estimates of World War II casualties indicate around 60 million people died, 40 million of whom were civilians."
" Since a high proportion of those killed were young men who had not yet fathered any children, population growth in the postwar Soviet Union was much lower than it otherwise would have been."
"Once a war has ended, losing nations are sometimes required to pay war reparations to the victorious nations."
" For example, the territory of Alsace-Lorraine has been traded between France and Germany on three different occasions."
"Typically, war becomes intertwined with the economy and many wars are partially or entirely based on economic reasons."
 Some economists believe war can stimulate a country's economy (high government spending for World War II is often credited with bringing the U.
" out of the Great Depression by most Keynesian economists), but in many cases, such as the wars of Louis XIV, the Franco-Prussian War, and World War I, warfare primarily results in damage to the economy of the countries involved."
" For example, Russia's involvement in World War I took such a toll on the Russian economy that it almost collapsed and greatly contributed to the start of the Russian Revolution of 1917."
World War II was the most financially costly conflict in history; its belligerents cumulatively spent about a trillion U.
The Great Depression of the 1930s ended as nations increased their production of war materials.
"By the end of the war, 70% of European industrial infrastructure was destroyed."
 Property damage in the Soviet Union inflicted by the Axis invasion was estimated at a value of 679 billion rubles.
" The combined damage consisted of complete or partial destruction of 1,710 cities and towns, 70,000 villages/hamlets, 2,508 church buildings, 31,850 industrial establishments, 40,000 mi (64,374 km) of railroad, 4100 railroad stations, 40,000 hospitals, 84,000 schools, and 43,000 public libraries."
"There are many theories about the motivations for war, but no consensus about which are most common."
" Carl von Clausewitz said, 'Every age has its own kind of war, its own limiting conditions, and its own peculiar preconceptions."
the inner fears of mankind are discharged in mass destruction.
 Durban and John Bowlby have argued human beings are inherently violent.
" This aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other races, religions, nations or ideologies."
" By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare."
"The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein, thought war was the paranoid or projective ""elaboration"" of mourning."
" Fornari thought war and violence develop out of our ""love need"": our wish to preserve and defend the sacred object to which we are attached, namely our early mother and our fusion with her."
" For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare."
" Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation."
"Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace."
 Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers.
 One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.
 He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power.
 War is caused by leaders who seek war such as Napoleon and Hitler.
" Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war."
"Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany."
" But, after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine the policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a Parliament or a Communist dictatorship."
 the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.
 All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.
Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare.
" There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and competition over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition."
"The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as chimpanzees, as well as in many ant species, group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior."
" Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states."
Psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory.
"  He also argued that in order to have credible deterrence against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation (""honor"")."
"Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which ""coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups"", is a characteristic of most human societies."
" Those in which it has been lacking ""tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors""."
"Ashley Montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare."
" Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies."
" Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e."
" Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive."
War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system.
 In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for natural resources and for wealth.
 War has also been linked to economic development by economic historians and development economists studying state-building and fiscal capacity.
" While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars."
" There are those on the extreme right of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force."
" Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including Presidents of the United States and U."
"The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the capitalism, particularly state-monopoly forms."
" Part of the theory is that war will disappear once a world revolution, over-throwing capitalism and state power, has occurred."
" Marxist economists Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Rudolf Hilferding and Vladimir Lenin theorized that imperialism was the result of capitalist countries needing new markets."
 Expansion of the means of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer demand.
" Since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism."
"Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories:
"
Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.
"Pope Urban II in 1095, on the eve of the First Crusade, advocating Crusade as a solution to European overpopulation, said:
"
"For this land which you now inhabit, shut in on all sides by the sea and the mountain peaks, is too narrow for your large population; it scarcely furnishes food enough for its cultivators."
" Hence it is that you murder and devour one another, that you wage wars, and that many among you perish in civil strife."
" Let hatred, therefore, depart from among you; let your quarrels end."
" Enter upon the road to the Holy Sepulchre; wrest that land from a wicked race, and subject it to yourselves."
"This is one of the earliest expressions of what has come to be called the Malthusian theory of war, in which wars are caused by expanding populations and limited resources."
" Thomas Malthus (1766–1834) wrote that populations always increase until they are limited by war, disease, or famine."
"The violent herder–farmer conflicts in Nigeria, Mali, Sudan and other countries in the Sahel region have been exacerbated by land degradation and population growth."
"According to Heinsohn, who proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the ""fighting age"" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age."
 It will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.
"Heinsohn saw both past ""Christianist"" European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges."
" Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the French Revolution of 1789, and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s."
 The 1994 Rwandan genocide has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge.
"Youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the World Bank, Population Action International, and the Berlin Institute for Population and Development."
" Youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age discrimination."
Rationalism is an international relations theory or framework.
" Rationalism (and Neorealism (international relations)) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war."
" Under one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs."
" Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the peace war game, optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played."
" In ""Rationalist Explanations for War"", James Fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:
"
"Commitment problems""Issue indivisibility"" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other."
"""Information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent"" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss."
" For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength."
" He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, ""war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power."
""" Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments."
"Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias, but are still ""as rational as you and me""."
" According to philosopher Iain King, ""Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury."
""" King asserts that ""Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in GroupThink"" which is faulty, but still rational."
The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate.
 The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I.
" More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program."
"The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis."
" This kind of division was first proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State, and War and has been often used by political scientists since then."
There are several different international relations theory schools.
" Supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the security dilemma."
"Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as Henry Kissinger and Hans Morgenthau, and the neorealist school represented by scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer, two main sub-theories are:
"
"Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition."
" In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and ""movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing."
""" However, evidence has shown power polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars."
"Power transition theory: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to preemptively suppress them."
" On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become more probable when power is more equally distributed."
" This ""power preponderance"" hypothesis has empirical support."
The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance.
"Liberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations."
"  Realists respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today."
" Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict."
" Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don't necessarily trade less with each other."
"Diversionary theory, also known as the ""scapegoat hypothesis"", suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support."
" This is supported by literature showing out-group hostility enhances in-group bonding, and a significant domestic ""rally effect"" has been demonstrated when conflicts begin."
" However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed."
 war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.
"These theories suggest differences in people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand."
" For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and various cognitive biases, such as prospect theory."
The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years.
"The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war theory, are jus ad bellum and Jus in bello."
"Jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation."
" There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used."
"Jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war."
 The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination.
 Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.
" The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not."
 Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.
 The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in International Law's regulations on legitimate war.
"Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as Pragmatism, racism, and social Darwinism, hold that violence is good."
" Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality."
" Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both."
 Social Darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish.
 These are broad archetypes for the general position that the ends justify the means.
" conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created."
" Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society."
"Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the Second Vatican Council document Gaudiem et Spes: ""Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man himself."
"""Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War."
" In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the United States invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq."
" Protests opposing the War in Afghanistan occurred in Europe, Asia, and the United States."
"The Mexican Drug War, with estimated casualties of 40,000 since December 2006, has recently faced fundamental opposition."
" In 2011, the movement for peace and justice has started a popular middle-class movement against the war."
" It won the recognition of President Calderon, who began the war."
"An Interactive map of all the battles fought around the world in the last 4,000 years

"Violence is the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy."
" Other definitions are also used, such as the World Health Organization's definition of violence as ""the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation."
"""Internationally, violence resulted in deaths of an estimated 1."
" Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention."
" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments."
" Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development."
"In 2013, of the estimated 405,000 deaths due to interpersonal violence globally, assault by firearm was the cause in 180,000 deaths, assault by sharp object was the cause in 114,000 deaths, and the remaining 110,000 deaths from other causes."
" There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors in a country such as an concentrated (regional) poverty, income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents."
" Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be relatively effective in preventing violence, although mental and physical health and individual responses, personalities, etc."
 have always been decisive factors in the formation of these behaviors.
"The World Health Organization divides violence into three broad categories:
"
"collective violenceThis initial categorization differentiates between violence that a person inflicts upon themself, violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals, and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, militia groups and terrorist organizations."
"Alternatively, violence can primarily be classified as either instrumental or reactive / hostile."
Self-directed violence is subdivided into suicidal behaviour and self-abuse.
" The former includes suicidal thoughts, attempted suicides—also called para suicide or deliberate self-injury in some countries—and completed suicides."
" Self-abuse, in contrast, includes acts such as self-mutilation."
"Unlike the other two broad categories, the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed by larger groups of individuals or by states."
" Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence."
" Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out by larger groups."
" Economic violence includes attacks by larger groups motivated by economic gain—such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation."
" Clearly, acts committed by larger groups can have multiple motives."
"War is a state of prolonged violent large-scale conflict involving two or more groups of people, usually under the auspices of government."
"War is fought as a means of resolving territorial and other conflicts, as war of aggression to conquer territory or loot resources, in national self-defence or liberation, or to suppress attempts of part of the nation to secede from it."
" There are also ideological, religious and revolutionary wars."
Since the Industrial Revolution the lethality of modern warfare has grown.
 World War I casualties were over 40 million and World War II casualties were over 70 million.
"Interpersonal violence is divided into two subcategories: Family and intimate partner violence—that is, violence largely between family members and intimate partners, usually, though not exclusively, taking place in the home."
" Community violence—violence between individuals who are unrelated, and who may or may not know each other, generally taking place outside the home."
" The former group includes forms of violence such as child abuse, intimate partner violence and abuse of the elderly."
" The latter includes youth violence, random acts of violence, rape or sexual assault by strangers, and violence in institutional settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes."
" When interpersonal violence occurs in families, its psychological consequences can affect parents, children, and their relationship in the short- and long-terms."
Child maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age.
" It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other child exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power."
 Exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment.
"Child maltreatment is a global problem with serious lifelong consequences, which is, however, complex and difficult to study."
There are no reliable global estimates for the prevalence of child maltreatment.
" Data for many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are lacking."
 Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used.
" Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused."
"Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and social and occupational functioning (e."
 These can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development.
 Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach.
 Effective prevention programmes support parents and teach positive parenting skills.
 Ongoing care of children and families can reduce the risk of maltreatment reoccurring and can minimize its consequences.
"Following the World Health Organization, youth are defined as people between the ages of 10 and 29 years."
" Youth violence refers to violence occurring between youths, and includes acts that range from bullying and physical fighting, through more severe sexual and physical assault to homicide."
"Worldwide some 250,000 homicides occur among youth 10–29 years of age each year, which is 41% of the total number of homicides globally each year (""Global Burden of Disease"", World Health Organization, 2008)."
" For each young person killed, 20–40 more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment."
" Youth violence has a serious, often lifelong, impact on a person's psychological and social functioning."
" Youth violence greatly increases the costs of health, welfare and criminal justice services; reduces productivity; decreases the value of property; and generally undermines the fabric of society."
"Prevention programmes shown to be effective or to have promise in reducing youth violence include life skills and social development programmes designed to help children and adolescents manage anger, resolve conflict, and develop the necessary social skills to solve problems; schools-based anti-bullying prevention programmes; and programmes to reduce access to alcohol, illegal drugs and guns."
" Also, given significant neighbourhood effects on youth violence, interventions involving relocating families to less poor environments have shown promising results."
" Similarly, urban renewal projects such as business improvement districts have shown a reduction in youth violence."
"Different types of youth on youth violence include witnessing or being involved in physical, emotional and sexual abuse (e."
" physical attacks, bullying, rape), and violent acts like gang shootings and robberies."
" According to researchers in 2018, ""More than half of children and adolescents living in cities have experienced some form of community violence."
""" The violence ""can also all take place under one roof, or in a given community or neighborhood and can happen at the same time or at different stages of life."
""" Youth violence has immediate and long term adverse impact whether the individual was the recipient of the violence or a witness to it."
"Youth violence impacts individuals, their families, and society."
" Victims can have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits, the cost of which quickly add up."
" Since the victims of youth-on-youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and/or mental injuries, it is often up to their family members to take care of them, including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills."
 Their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence.
 This causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills.
 Recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child's brain.
" ""Trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety, rage, and the ability to concentrate."
" They can also have problems remembering, trusting, and forming relationships."
""" Since the brain becomes used to violence it may stay continually in an alert state (similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode)."
" ""Researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional, social, and cognitive problems."
" They may have trouble controlling emotions, paying attention in school, withdraw from friends, or show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder""."
It is important for youth exposed to violence to understand how their bodies may react so they can take positive steps to counteract any possible short- and long-term negative effects (e.
", poor concentration, feelings of depression, heightened levels of anxiety)."
" By taking immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the trauma they've experienced, negative repercussions can be reduced or eliminated."
" As an initial step, the youths need to understand why they may be feeling a certain way and to understand how the violence they have experienced may be causing negative feelings and making them behave differently."
" Pursuing a greater awareness of their feelings, perceptions, and negative emotions is the first step that should be taken as part of recovering from the trauma they have experienced."
 “Neuroscience research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going on inside ourselves”.
"Some of the ways to combat the adverse effects of exposure to youth violence would be to try various mindfulness and movement activities, deep breathing exercises and other actions that enable youths to release their pent up emotions."
" Using these techniques will teach body awareness, reduce anxiety and nervousness, and reduce feelings of anger and annoyance."
 Over time these types of activities will help these younger victims of violence to have greater control over their feelings and behaviors and avoid unhealthy ways of coping.
 Another way to help trauma victims of youth violence is through the arts.
" This can be accomplished by giving them the opportunity to engage in drawing, painting, music, and singing which will give them an outlet to express themselves and their emotions in a positive way."
Youth who have experienced violence benefit from having a close relationship with one or more people.
 This is important because the trauma victims need to have people who are safe and trustworthy that they can relate and talk to about their horrible experiences.
 Some youth do not have adult figures at home or someone they can count on for guidance and comfort.
 Schools in bad neighborhoods where youth violence is prevalent should assign counselors to each student so that they receive regular guidance.
" In addition to counseling/therapy sessions and programs, it has been recommended that schools offer mentoring programs where students can interact with adults who can be a positive influence on them."
 Another way is to create more neighborhood programs to ensure that each child has a positive and stable place to go when school in not in session.
 Many children have benefited from formal organizations now which aim to help mentor and provide a safe environment for the youth especially those living in neighborhoods with higher rates of violence.
" This includes organizations such as Becoming a Man, CeaseFire Illinois, Chicago Area Project, Little Black Pearl, and Rainbow House""."
" These programs are designed to help give the youth a safe place to go, stop the violence from occurring, offering counseling and mentoring to help stop the cycle of violence."
" If the youth do not have a safe place to go after school hours they will likely get into trouble, receive poor grades, drop out of school and use drugs and alcohol."
 The gangs look for youth who do not have positive influences in their life and need protection.
 This is why these programs are so important for the youth to have a safe environment rather than resorting to the streets.
"Intimate partner violence refers to behaviour in an intimate relationship that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours."
Population-level surveys based on reports from victims provide the most accurate estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual violence in non-conflict settings.
" A study conducted by WHO in 10 mainly developing countries found that, among women aged 15 to 49 years, between 15% (Japan) and 70% (Ethiopia and Peru) of women reported physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner."
"Intimate partner and sexual violence have serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for victims and for their children, and lead to high social and economic costs."
" These include both fatal and non-fatal injuries, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, including HIV."
"Factors associated with the perpetration and experiencing of intimate partner violence are low levels of education, history of violence as a perpetrator, a victim or a witness of parental violence, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes that are accepting of violence as well as marital discord and dissatisfaction."
" Factors associated only with perpetration of intimate partner violence are having multiple partners, and antisocial personality disorder."
"A recent theory named ""The Criminal Spin"" suggests a mutual flywheel effect between partners that is manifested by an escalation in the violence."
" A violent spin may occur in any other forms of violence, but in Intimate partner violence the added value is the mutual spin, based on the unique situation and characteristics of intimate relationship."
The primary prevention strategy with the best evidence for effectiveness for intimate partner violence is school-based programming for adolescents to prevent violence within dating relationships.
" Evidence is emerging for the effectiveness of several other primary prevention strategies—those that: combine microfinance with gender equality training; promote communication and relationship skills within communities; reduce access to, and the harmful use of alcohol; and change cultural gender norms."
"Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting."
" It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object."
Population-level surveys based on reports from victims estimate that between 0.
" Sexual violence has serious short- and long-term consequences on physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health for victims and for their children as described in the section on intimate partner violence."
" If perpetrated during childhood, sexual violence can lead to increased smoking, drug and alcohol misuse, and risky sexual behaviors in later life."
 It is also associated with perpetration of violence and being a victim of violence.
Many of the risk factors for sexual violence are the same as for domestic violence.
" Risk factors specific to sexual violence perpetration include beliefs in family honor and sexual purity, ideologies of male sexual entitlement and weak legal sanctions for sexual violence."
Few interventions to prevent sexual violence have been demonstrated to be effective.
" School-based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising, but require further research."
" To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact legislation and develop policies that protect women; address discrimination against women and promote gender equality; and help to move the culture away from violence."
"Elder maltreatment is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person."
" This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes physical, sexual, psychological, emotional; financial and material abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious loss of dignity and respect."
"While there is little information regarding the extent of maltreatment in elderly populations, especially in developing countries, it is estimated that 4–6% of elderly people in high-income countries have experienced some form of maltreatment at home However, older people are often afraid to report cases of maltreatment to family, friends, or to the authorities."
" Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce."
 Elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences.
 Elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.
"Many strategies have been implemented to prevent elder maltreatment and to take action against it and mitigate its consequences including public and professional awareness campaigns, screening (of potential victims and abusers), caregiver support interventions (e."
" stress management, respite care), adult protective services and self-help groups."
" Their effectiveness has, however, not so far been well-established."
"Several rare but painful episodes of assassination, attempted assassination and school shootings at elementary, middle, high schools, as well as colleges and universities in the United States, led to a considerable body of research on ascertainable behaviors of persons who have planned or carried out such attacks."
" These studies (1995–2002) investigated what the authors called ""targeted violence,"" described the ""path to violence"" of those who planned or carried out attacks and laid out suggestions for law enforcement and educators."
" A major point from these research studies is that targeted violence does not just ""come out of the blue""."
"As an anthropological concept, ""everyday violence"" may refer to the incorporation of different forms of violence (mainly political violence) into daily practices."
" Latin America and the Caribbean, the region with the highest murder rate in the world, experienced more than 2."
Some philosophers have argued that any interpretation of reality is intrinsically violent.
" Slavoj Žižek in his book Violence stated that ""something violent is the very symbolization of a thing."
""" This harm inflicted by the very interpretation of the world is known as ontological violence."
  Ontological violence is distinct from physical violence in that it is possible to avoid physical violence whereas some ontological is intrinsic to all knowledge.
Both Foucault and Arendt considered the relationship between power and violence but concluded that while related they are distinct.
"In feminist philosophy, epistemic violence is the act of causing harm by an inability to understand the conversation of others due to ignorance."
 Some philosophers think this will harm marginalized groups.
Violence cannot be attributed to solely protective factors or risk factors.
" Both of these factor groups are equally important in the prevention, intervention, and treatment of violence as a whole."
" The CDC outlines several risk and protective factors for youth violence at the individual, family, social and community levels."
"Individual risk factors include poor behavioral control, high emotional stress, low IQ, and antisocial beliefs or attitudes."
" Family risk factors include authoritarian childrearing attitudes, inconsistent disciplinary practices, low emotional attachment to parents or caregivers, and low parental income and involvement."
" Social risk factors include social rejection, poor academic performance and commitment to school, and gang involvement or association with delinquent peers."
" Community risk factors include poverty, low community participation, and diminished economic opportunities."
"On the other hand, individual protective factors include an intolerance towards deviance, higher IQ and GPA, elevated popularity and social skills, as well as religious beliefs."
" Family protective factors include a connectedness and ability to discuss issues with family members or adults, parent/family use of constructive coping strategies, and consistent parental presence during at least one of the following: when awakening, when arriving home from school, at dinner time, or when going to bed."
" Social protective factors include quality school relationships, close relationships with non-deviant peers, involvement in prosocial activities, and exposure to school climates that are: well supervised, use clear behavior rules and disciplinary approaches, and engage parents with teachers."
"With many conceptual factors that occur at varying levels in the lives of those impacted, the exact causes of violence are complex."
" To represent this complexity, the ecological, or social ecological model is often used."
" The following four-level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence:
"
"The first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence: demographic characteristics (age, education, income), genetics, brain lesions, personality disorders, substance abuse, and a history of experiencing, witnessing, or engaging in violent behaviour."
"The second level focuses on close relationships, such as those with family and friends."
" In youth violence, for example, having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person's risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence."
" For intimate partner violence, a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship."
" In elder abuse, important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver."
" Risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade, the absence of social networks, and concentrated poverty."
 All these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence.
"Finally, the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited: the responsiveness of the criminal justice system, social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent-child relationships, income inequality, the strength of the social welfare system, the social acceptability of violence, the availability of weapons, the exposure to violence in mass media, and political instability."
"While studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression, a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors."
 Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of corporal punishment of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies.
" For instance, a 2005 analysis of 186 pre-industrial societies found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide, assault, and war."
" In the United States, domestic corporal punishment has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses."
" Straus believes that disciplinary spanking forms ""the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families"", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later domestic violence and crime."
The causes of violent behavior in people are often a topic of research in psychology.
" Neurobiologist Jan Vodka emphasizes that, for those purposes, ""violent behavior is defined as overt and intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person."
"""Based on the idea of human nature, scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans."
" Among prehistoric humans, there is archaeological evidence for both contentions of violence and peacefulness as primary characteristics."
"Since violence is a matter of perception as well as a measurable phenomenon, psychologists have found variability in whether people perceive certain physical acts as ""violent""."
" For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as ""violent"", though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently."
" Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression."
"The concept of violence normalization, is known as socially sanctioned or structural violence, and is a topic of increasing interest to researchers trying to understand violent behavior."
" It has been discussed at length by researchers in sociology, medical anthropology, psychology, psychiatry, philosophy, and bioarchaeology."
"Evolutionary psychology offers several explanations for human violence in various contexts, such as sexual jealousy in humans, child abuse, and homicide."
 Goetz (2010) argues that humans are similar to most mammal species and use violence in specific situations.
" He writes that ""Buss and Shackelford (1997a) proposed seven adaptive problems our ancestors recurrently faced that might have been solved by aggression: co-opting the resources of others, defending against attack, inflicting costs on same-sex rivals, negotiating status and hierarchies, deterring rivals from future aggression, deterring mate from infidelity, and reducing resources expended on genetically unrelated children."
"""Goetz writes that most homicides seem to start from relatively trivial disputes between unrelated men who then escalate to violence and death."
 He argues that such conflicts occur when there is a status dispute between men of relatively similar status.
" If there is a great initial status difference, then the lower status individual usually offers no challenge and if challenged the higher status individual usually ignores the lower status individual."
 At the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status.
Research into the media and violence examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists.
" Although some scholars had claimed media violence may increase aggression, this view is coming increasingly in doubt both in the scholarly community and was rejected by the US Supreme Court in the Brown v EMA case, as well as in a review of video game violence by the Australian Government (2010) which concluded evidence for harmful effects were inconclusive at best and the rhetoric of some scholars was not matched by good data."
The threat and enforcement of physical punishment has been a tried and tested method of preventing some violence since civilisation began.
"Cities and counties throughout the United States organize “Violence Prevention Months” where the mayor, by proclamation, or the county, by a resolution, encourage the private, community and public sectors to engage in activities that raise awareness that violence is not acceptable through art, music, lectures and events."
" For example, Violence Prevention Month coordinator, Karen Earle Lile in Contra Costa County, California created a Wall of Life, where children drew pictures that were put up in the walls of banks and public spaces, displaying a child’s view of violence they had witnessed and how it affected them, in an effort to draw attention to how violence affects the community, not just the people involved."
A review of scientific literature by the World Health Organization on the effectiveness of strategies to prevent interpersonal violence identified the seven strategies below as being supported by either strong or emerging evidence for effectiveness.
 These strategies target risk factors at all four levels of the ecological model.
Among the most effective such programmes to prevent child maltreatment and reduce childhood aggression are the Nurse Family Partnership home-visiting programme and the Triple P (Parenting Program).
" There is also emerging evidence that these programmes reduce convictions and violent acts in adolescence and early adulthood, and probably help decrease intimate partner violence and self-directed violence in later life."
"Evidence shows that the life skills acquired in social development programmes can reduce involvement in violence, improve social skills, boost educational achievement and improve job prospects."
" Life skills refer to social, emotional, and behavioural competencies which help children and adolescents effectively deal with the challenges of everyday life."
Evaluation studies are beginning to support community interventions that aim to prevent violence against women by promoting gender equality.
" For instance, evidence suggests that programmes that combine microfinance with gender equity training can reduce intimate partner violence."
 School-based programmes such as Safe Dates programme in the United States of America and the Youth Relationship Project in Canada have been found to be effective for reducing dating violence.
Rules or expectations of behaviour – norms – within a cultural or social group can encourage violence.
" Interventions that challenge cultural and social norms supportive of violence can prevent acts of violence and have been widely used, but the evidence base for their effectiveness is currently weak."
 The effectiveness of interventions addressing dating violence and sexual abuse among teenagers and young adults by challenging social and cultural norms related to gender is supported by some evidence.
Interventions to identify victims of interpersonal violence and provide effective care and support are critical for protecting health and breaking cycles of violence from one generation to the next.
" Examples for which evidence of effectiveness is emerging includes: screening tools to identify victims of intimate partner violence and refer them to appropriate services; psychosocial interventions—such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy—to reduce mental health problems associated with violence, including post-traumatic stress disorder; and protection orders, which prohibit a perpetrator from contacting the victim, to reduce repeat victimization among victims of intimate partner violence."
"Not surprisingly, scientific evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent collective violence is lacking."
" However, policies that facilitate reductions in poverty, that make decision-making more accountable, that reduce inequalities between groups, as well as policies that reduce access to biological, chemical, nuclear and other weapons have been recommended."
" When planning responses to violent conflicts, recommended approaches include assessing at an early stage who is most vulnerable and what their needs are, co-ordination of activities between various players and working towards global, national and local capabilities so as to deliver effective health services during the various stages of an emergency."
 Sociologist Max Weber stated that the state claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of force practised within the confines of a specific territory.
 Law enforcement is the main means of regulating nonmilitary violence in society.
" Governments regulate the use of violence through legal systems governing individuals and political authorities, including the police and military."
" Civil societies authorize some amount of violence, exercised through the police power, to maintain the status quo and enforce laws."
"However, German political theorist Hannah Arendt noted: ""Violence can be justifiable, but it never will be legitimate ."
 Its justification loses in plausibility the farther its intended end recedes into the future.
" No one questions the use of violence in self-defence, because the danger is not only clear but also present, and the end justifying the means is immediate""."
 Arendt made a clear distinction between violence and power.
 Most political theorists regarded violence as an extreme manifestation of power whereas Arendt regarded the two concepts as opposites.
"In the 20th century in acts of democide governments may have killed more than 260 million of their own people through police brutality, execution, massacre, slave labour camps, and sometimes through intentional famine."
"Violent acts that are not carried out by the military or police and that are not in self-defense are usually classified as crimes, although not all crimes are violent crimes."
 Damage to property is classified as violent crime in some jurisdictions but not in all.
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) classifies violence resulting in homicide into criminal homicide and justifiable homicide (e.
"The criminal justice approach sees its main task as enforcing laws that proscribe violence and ensuring that ""justice is done""."
" The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice's approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system's main tasks is to ""do justice"", i."
" to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately."
" To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators."
"The criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators."
" One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes—through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one's psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences)."
"In recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs."
" For instance, much of community and problem-oriented policing aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it—and not to increase the number of arrests."
" Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency."
 Juvenile justice systems—an important component of criminal justice systems—are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention.
" In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children's access to guns and teach conflict resolution."
" Despite this, force is used routinely against juveniles by police."
" In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the ""Blueprints for violence prevention"" programme at the University of Colorado Boulder."
"The public health approach is a science-driven, population-based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention."
" Rather than focusing on individuals, the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people, and to extend better care and safety to entire populations."
" The public health approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education and economics."
" Because all forms of violence are multi-faceted problems, the public health approach emphasizes a multi-sectoral response."
" It has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health, education, social welfare, and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely ""criminal"" or ""medical"" problems."
" The public health approach considers that violence, rather than being the result of any single factor, is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes, interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy (individual, close relationship/family, community and wider society) of the Social ecological model."
"From a public health perspective, prevention strategies can be classified into three types:
"
Primary prevention – approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs.
"Secondary prevention – approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence, such as pre-hospital care, emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape."
"Tertiary prevention – approaches that focus on long-term care in the wake of violence, such as rehabilitation and reintegration, and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long-term disability associated with violence."
"A public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence, i."
" Until recently, this approach has been relatively neglected in the field, with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention."
" Perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible ""symptoms""."
 This allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health.
"The public health approach is an evidence-based and systematic process involving the following four steps:
"
"Defining the problem conceptually and numerically, using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence, the characteristics of those most affected, the geographical distribution of incidents, and the consequences of exposure to such violence."
"Investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence (risk and protective factors) and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention."
"Exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing, monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations."
Disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes.
" Approaches to prevent violence, whether targeted at individuals or entire communities, must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared."
 This step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re-evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting.
"In many countries, violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health."
 The public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences.
" In 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases."
" In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to ""extending life"" or to a ""complete state of well-being""."
" He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians."
"However, it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence, and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level."
 This is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences.
The global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid-1990s.
" In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49."
"25 which declared violence ""a leading worldwide public health problem"" and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels."
 The World Health Organization's initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).
The case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments.
" First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it."
" The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work."
" Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach."
" Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places—which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries—than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse—which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence."
" Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence."
"The human rights approach is based on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent, eradicate and punish violence."
" It recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights: the rights to life, liberty, autonomy and security of the person; the rights to equality and non-discrimination; the rights to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; the right to privacy; and the right to the highest attainable standard of health."
" These human rights are enshrined in international and regional treaties and national constitutions and laws, which stipulate the obligations of states, and include mechanisms to hold states accountable."
" The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, for example, requires that countries party to the Convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women."
" The Convention on the Rights of the Child in its Article 19 states that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child."
"Violence, as defined in the dictionary of human geography, ""appears whenever power is in jeopardy"" and ""in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose: it is part of a larger matrix of socio-political power struggles""."
" Violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories—direct violence, structural violence and cultural violence."
" Thus defined and delineated, it is of note, as Hyndman says, that ""geography came late to theorizing violence"" in comparison to other social sciences."
" Social and human geography, rooted in the humanist, Marxist, and feminist subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn, have long been concerned with social and spatial justice."
"Along with critical geographers and political geographers, it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence."
" Keeping this idea of social/spatial justice via geography in mind, it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics."
"Derek Gregory and Alan Pred assembled the influential edited collection Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence, which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present."
" Evidently, political violence often gives a part for the state to play."
" When ""modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law"", the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence."
 Philosopher Giorgio Agamben's concepts of state of exception and homo sacer are useful to consider within a geography of violence.
" The state, in the grip of a perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government's lager or concentration camp can occur)."
" However, when this ""in limbo"" reality is designed to be in place ""until further notice…the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself""."
" For Agamben, the physical space of the camp ""is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space""."
" At the scale of the body, in the state of exception, a person is so removed from their rights by ""juridical procedures and deployments of power"" that ""no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime""; in other words, people become only homo sacer."
" Guantanamo Bay could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer."
"In the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot resulted in the deaths of over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence."
" About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at Choeung Ek, which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the Killing Fields."
" The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy."
 People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made homo sacer in a condition of bare life.
 The Killing Fields—manifestations of Agamben's concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law—featured the state of exception.
" As part of Pol Pot's ""ideological intent…to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative"", he ""dismantled the country's existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area""."
" Forced movement, such as this forced movement applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence."
" When ""symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind…were purged or torn down"", cultural violence (defined as when ""any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence"") is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields."
 Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended.
" However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia."
"Human geography, though coming late to the theorizing table, has tackled violence through many lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography."
" However, Adriana Cavarero notes that, ""as violence spreads and assumes unheard-of forms, it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language""."
" Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as ""horrorism""; that is, ""as though ideally all the…victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name""."
" With geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science, rather than creating them solely within the discipline, it seems that the self-reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current (re)imaging of violence, exemplified by Cavarero."
" Suicide accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000."
" Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990."
5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.
"21 million), and malaria (830'000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1."
"For every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries."
" In 2008, over 16 million cases of non-fatal violence-related injuries were severe enough to require medical attention."
" Beyond deaths and injuries, forms of violence such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder maltreatment have been found to be highly prevalent."
"In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide."
" Suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years in some countries, and the second leading cause of death in the 10–24 years age group."
 These figures do not include suicide attempts which are up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicide.
 Suicide was the 16th leading cause of death worldwide in 2004 and is projected to increase to the 12th in 2030.
" Although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly, rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and developing countries."
Rates and patterns of violent death vary by country and region.
" In recent years, homicide rates have been highest in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean and lowest in East Asia, the western Pacific, and some countries in northern Africa."
" Studies show a strong, inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality."
" Poorer countries, especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor, tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries."
" For the 15 to 29 age group, male rates were nearly six times those for female rates; for the remaining age groups, male rates were from two to four times those for females."
"Studies in a number of countries show that, for every homicide among young people age 10 to 24, 20 to 40 other young people receive hospital treatment for a violent injury."
Forms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence are highly prevalent.
" Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused."
 A WHO multi-country study found that between 15–71% of women reported experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives.
"Wars grab headlines, but the individual risk of dying violently in an armed conflict is today relatively low—much lower than the risk of violent death in many countries that are not suffering from an armed conflict."
" For example, between 1976 and 2008, African Americans were victims of 329,825 homicides."
" Although there is a widespread perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world, the average person living in a conflict-affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2."
 This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.
 This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence.
" Certainly, there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level, and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high."
" In Iraq, for example, the direct conflict death rate for 2004–07 was 65 per 100,000 people per year and, in Somalia, 24 per 100,000 people."
" This rate even reached peaks of 91 per 100,000 in Iraq in 2006 and 74 per 100,000 in Somalia in 2007."
"Scientific evidence for warfare has come from settled, sedentary communities."
" Some scholars argue humans may have a predisposition for violence (chimpanzees, also great apes, have been known to kill members of competing groups for resources like food), placing the origins of organized violence prior to modern settled societies."
" However, actual evidence suggests that organized, large-scale, militaristic, or regular human-on-human violence was absent for the vast majority of the human timeline, and is first documented to have started only relatively recently in the Holocene, an epoch that began about 11,700 years ago, probably with the advent of higher population densities due to sedentism."
" Fry writes that scholars are divided on the origins of this greater degree of violence—in other words, war-like behavior: There are basically two schools of thought on this issue."
 goes back at least to the time of the first thoroughly modern humans and even before then to the primate ancestors of the hominid lineage.
 The second positions on the origins of warfare sees war as much less common in the cultural and biological evolution of humans.
" Here, warfare is a latecomer on the cultural horizon, only arising in very specific material circumstances and being quite rare in human history until the development of agriculture in the past 10,000 years."
"Jared Diamond in his books Guns, Germs and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee posits that the rise of large-scale warfare is the result of advances in technology and city-states."
" For instance, the rise of agriculture provided a significant increase in the number of individuals that a region could sustain over hunter-gatherer societies, allowing for development of specialized classes such as soldiers, or weapons manufacturers."
"In academia, the idea of the peaceful pre-history and non-violent tribal societies gained popularity with the post-colonial perspective."
" The trend, starting in archaeology and spreading to anthropology reached its height in the late half of the 20th century."
" However, some newer research in archaeology and bioarchaeology may provide evidence that violence within and among groups is not a recent phenomenon."
" According to the book ""The Bioarchaeology of Violence"" violence is a behavior that is found throughout human history."
" Keeley at the University of Illinois writes in War Before Civilization that 87% of tribal societies were at war more than once per year, and that 65% of them were fighting continuously."
" He writes that the attrition rate of numerous close-quarter clashes, which characterize endemic warfare, produces casualty rates of up to 60%, compared to 1% of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare."
" ""Primitive Warfare"" of these small groups or tribes was driven by the basic need for sustenance and violent competition."
"Fry explores Keeley's argument in depth and counters that such sources erroneously focus on the ethnography of hunters and gatherers in the present, whose culture and values have been infiltrated externally by modern civilization, rather than the actual archaeological record spanning some two million years of human existence."
" Fry determines that all present ethnographically studied tribal societies, ""by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists, have been irrevocably impacted by history and modern colonial nation states"" and that ""many have been affected by state societies for at least 5000 years."
"""The relatively peaceful period since World War II is known as the Long Peace."
"Steven Pinker's 2011 book, The Better Angels of Our Nature, argued that modern society is less violent than in periods of the past, whether on the short scale of decades or long scale of centuries or millennia."
"Steven Pinker argues that by every possible measure, every type of violence has drastically decreased since ancient and medieval times."
" A few centuries ago, for example, genocide was a standard practice in all kinds of warfare and was so common that historians did not even bother to mention it."
" Cannibalism and slavery have been greatly reduced in the last thousand years, and capital punishment is now banned in many countries."
" According to Pinker, rape, murder, warfare and animal cruelty have all seen drastic declines in the 20th century."
" Pinker's analyses have also been criticized, concerning the statistical question of how to measure violence and whether it is in fact declining."
"Pinker's observation of the decline in interpersonal violence echoes the work of Norbert Elias, who attributes the decline to a ""civilizing process"", in which the state's monopolization of violence, the maintenance of socioeconomic interdependencies or ""figurations"", and the maintenance of behavioural codes in culture all contribute to the development of individual sensibilities, which increase the repugnance of individuals towards violent acts."
" According to a 2010 study, non-lethal violence, such as assaults or bullying appear to be declining as well."
Some scholars disagree with the argument that all violence is decreasing arguing that not all types of violent behaviour are lower now than in the past.
" They suggest that research typically focuses on lethal violence, often looks at homicide rates of death due to warfare, but ignore the less obvious forms of violence."
"Beyond deaths and injuries, highly prevalent forms of violence (such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence) have serious lifelong non-injury health consequences."
" Victims may engage in high-risk behaviours such as alcohol and substance misuse and smoking, which in turn can contribute to cardiovascular disorders, cancers, depression, diabetes and HIV/AIDS, resulting in premature death."
" The balances of prevention, mitigation, mediation and exacerbation are complex, and vary with the underpinnings of violence."
"In countries with high levels of violence, economic growth can be slowed down, personal and collective security eroded, and social development impeded."
 Families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner.
 Communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth.
" For societies, meeting the direct costs of health, criminal justice, and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending."
" The much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development, increase socioeconomic inequality, and erode human and social capital."
"Additionally, communities with high level of violence do not provide the level of stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy."
 Individuals will be less likely to invest money and effort towards growth in such unstable and violent conditions.
 One of the possible proves might be the study of Baten and Gust that used “regicide” as measurement unit to approximate the influence of interpersonal violence and depict the influence of high interpersonal violence on economic development and level of investments.
 The results of the research prove the correlation of the human capital and the interpersonal violence.
"In 2016, the Institute for Economics and Peace, released the Economic Value of Peace report, which estimates the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy, the total economic impact of violence on the world economy in 2015 was estimated to be $13."
Religious and political ideologies have been the cause of interpersonal violence throughout history.
" Ideologues often falsely accuse others of violence, such as the ancient blood libel against Jews, the medieval accusations of casting witchcraft spells against women, and modern accusations of satanic ritual abuse against day care center owners and others."
Both supporters and opponents of the 21st-century War on Terrorism regard it largely as an ideological and religious war.
"Vittorio Bufacchi describes two different modern concepts of violence, one the ""minimalist conception"" of violence as an intentional act of excessive or destructive force, the other the ""comprehensive conception"" which includes violations of rights, including a long list of human needs."
 They believe private property and profit survive only because police violence defends them and that capitalist economies need war to expand.
" They may use the term ""structural violence"" to describe the systematic ways in which a given social structure or institution kills people slowly by preventing them from meeting their basic needs, for example the deaths caused by diseases because of lack of medicine."
"Frantz Fanon critiqued the violence of colonialism and wrote about the counter violence of the ""colonized victims."
"""Throughout history, most religions and individuals like Mahatma Gandhi have preached that humans are capable of eliminating individual violence and organizing societies through purely nonviolent means."
" Gandhi himself once wrote: ""A society organized and run on the basis of complete non-violence would be the purest anarchy."
""" Modern political ideologies which espouse similar views include pacifist varieties of voluntarism, mutualism, anarchism and libertarianism."
" But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly."
 The effect of limitation to a “killing fields” perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence.
" We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others."
" In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills."
" Some of the most pervasive and most dangerous forms of violence are those that are often hidden from view (against women and children, especially); just beneath the surface in many of our homes, churches, and communities is abuse enough to freeze the

" Moreover, many forms of systemic violence often slip past our attention because they are so much a part of the infrastructure of life (e."

"Jihad (English:  ; Arabic: جهاد‎ jihād [dʒɪˈhaːd]) is an Arabic word which literally means striving or struggling, especially with a praiseworthy aim."
" In an Islamic context, it can refer to almost any effort to make personal and social life conform with God's guidance, such as struggle against one's evil inclinations, proselytizing, or efforts toward the moral betterment of the ummah, though it is most frequently associated with war."
" In classical Islamic law, the term refers to armed struggle against unbelievers, while modernist Islamic scholars generally equate military jihad with defensive warfare."
" In Sufi and pious circles, spiritual and moral jihad has been traditionally emphasized under the name of greater jihad."
 The term has gained additional attention in recent decades through its use by terrorist groups.
"The word jihad appears frequently in the Quran with and without military connotations, often in the idiomatic expression ""striving in the path of God (al-jihad fi sabil Allah)""."
 Islamic jurists and other ulama of the classical era understood the obligation of jihad predominantly in a military sense.
" They developed an elaborate set of rules pertaining to jihad, including prohibitions on harming those who are not engaged in combat."
"In the modern era, the notion of jihad has lost its jurisprudential relevance and instead given rise to an ideological and political discourse."
" While modernist Islamic scholars have emphasized defensive and non-military aspects of jihad, some Islamists have advanced aggressive interpretations that go beyond the classical theory."
"Jihad is classified into inner (""greater"") jihad, which involves a struggle against one's own base impulses, and external (""lesser"") jihad, which is further subdivided into jihad of the pen/tongue (debate or persuasion) and jihad of the sword."
" Most Western writers consider external jihad to have primacy over inner jihad in the Islamic tradition, while much of contemporary Muslim opinion favors the opposite view."
 Gallup analysis of a large survey reveals considerable nuance in the conceptions of jihad held by Muslims around the world.
"Jihad is sometimes referred to as the sixth pillar of Islam, though this designation is not commonly recognized."
 In Twelver Shi'a Islam jihad is one of the ten Practices of the Religion.
 A person engaged in jihad is called a mujahid (plural mujahideen).
" The term jihad is often rendered in English as ""Holy War"", although this translation is controversial."
" Today, the word jihad is often used without religious connotations, like the English crusade."
"In Modern Standard Arabic, the term jihad is used for a struggle for causes, both religious and secular."
" The Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic defines the term as ""fight, battle; jihad, holy war (against the infidels, as a religious duty)""."
" Nonetheless, it is usually used in the religious sense and its beginnings are traced back to the Qur'an and the words and actions of Muhammad."
 The notion of Jihad has its origins in the Islamic principle that the whole humankind must embrace Islam.
" In the Qur'an and in later Muslim usage, jihad is commonly followed by the expression fi sabil illah, ""in the path of God."
""" Muhammad Abdel-Haleem states that it indicates ""the way of truth and justice, including all the teachings it gives on the justifications and the conditions for the conduct of war and peace."
""" It is sometimes used without religious connotation, with a meaning similar to the English word ""crusade"" (as in ""a crusade against drugs"")."
"According to Ahmed al-Dawoody, seventeen derivatives of jihād occur altogether forty-one times in eleven Meccan texts and thirty Medinan ones, with the following five meanings: striving because of religious belief (21), war (12), non-Muslim parents exerting pressure, that is, jihād, to make their children abandon Islam (2), solemn oaths (5), and physical strength (1)."
"The context of the Quran is elucidated by Hadith (the teachings, deeds and sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad)."
 Of the 199 references to jihad in perhaps the most standard collection of hadith—Bukhari—all assume that jihad means warfare.
"Among reported sayings of the Islamic prophet Muhammad involving jihad are
"
The best Jihad is the word of Justice in front of the oppressive sultan.
" He said: ""The best jihad is the one in which your horse is slain and your blood is spilled."
"Ibn Nuhaas also cited a hadith from Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, where Muhammad states that the highest kind of jihad is ""The person who is killed whilst spilling the last of his blood"" (Ahmed 4/144)."
"According to another hadith, supporting one's parents is also an example of jihad."
 It has also been reported that Muhammad considered performing hajj well to be the best jihad for Muslim women.
The practice of periodic raids by Bedouins against enemy tribes and settlements to collect spoils predates the revelations of the Quran.
" According to some scholars (such as James Turner Johnson), while Islamic leaders ""instilled into the hearts of the warriors the belief"" in jihad ""holy war"" and ghaza (raids), the ""fundamental structure"" of this bedouin warfare ""remained, ."
"According to Jonathan Berkey, the Quran's statements in support of jihad may have originally been directed against Muhammad's local enemies, the pagans of Mecca or the Jews of Medina, but these same statements could be redirected once new enemies appeared."
"According to another scholar (Majid Khadduri), it was the shift in focus to the conquest and spoils collecting of non-Bedouin unbelievers and away from traditional inter-bedouin tribal raids, that may have made it possible for Islam not only to expand but to avoid self-destruction."
"According with Bernard Lewis, ""from an early date Muslim law laid down"" jihad in the military sense as ""one of the principal obligations"" of both ""the head of the Muslim state"", who declared the jihad, and the Muslim community."
" According to legal historian Sadakat Kadri, Islamic jurists first developed classical doctrine of jihad ""towards the end of the eighth century"", using the doctrine of naskh (that God gradually improved His revelations over the course of Muhammed's mission) they subordinated verses in the Quran emphasizing harmony to more the more ""confrontational"" verses of Muhammad's later years and linked verses on exertion (jihad) to those of fighting (qital)."
" Muslims jurists of the eighth century developed a paradigm of international relations that divides the world into three conceptual divisions, dar al-Islam/dar al-‛adl/dar al-salam (house of Islam/house of justice/house of peace), dar al-harb/dar al-jawr (house of war/house of injustice, oppression), and dar al-sulh/dar al-‛ahd/dār al-muwada‛ah (house of peace/house of covenant/house of reconciliation)."
" 161/778) headed what Khadduri calls a pacifist school, which maintained that jihad was only a defensive war."
" He also states that the jurists who held this position, among whom he refers to Hanafi jurists al-Awza‛i (d."
" 179/795), and other early jurists, ""stressed that tolerance should be shown unbelievers, especially scripturaries and advised the Imam to prosecute war only when the inhabitants of the dar al-harb came into conflict with Islam."
" It was to be directed only by the caliph who might delayed it when convenient, negotiating truces for up to ten years at a time."
" Within classical Islamic jurisprudence—the development of which is to be dated into—the first few centuries after the prophet's death—jihad consisted of wars against unbelievers, apostates, and was the only form of warfare permissible."
" (Another source—Bernard Lewis—states that fighting rebels and bandits was legitimate though not a form of jihad, and that while the classical perception and presentation of the jihad was warfare in the field against a foreign enemy, internal jihad ""against an infidel renegade, or otherwise illegitimate regime was not unknown."
"The primary aim of jihad as warfare is not the conversion of non-Muslims to Islam by force, but rather the expansion and defense of the Islamic state."
" In theory, jihad was to continue until ""all mankind either embraced Islam or submitted to the authority of the Muslim state."
""" There could be truces before this was achieved, but no permanent peace."
" One who died ""on the path of God"" was a martyr (shahid), whose sins were remitted and who was secured ""immediate entry to paradise""."
"However, some argue martyrdom is never automatic because it is within God's exclusive province to judge who is worthy of that designation."
"Classical manuals of Islamic jurisprudence often contained a section called Book of Jihad, with rules governing the conduct of war covered at great length."
" Such rules include treatment of nonbelligerents, women, children (also cultivated or residential areas), and division of spoils."
" Spoils include Ghanimah (spoils obtained by actual fighting), and fai (obtained without fighting i."
The first documentation of the law of jihad was written by 'Abd al-Rahman al-Awza'i and Muhammad ibn al-Hasan al-Shaybani.
 (It grew out of debates that surfaced following Muhammad's death.
"Although some Islamic scholars have differed on the implementation of Jihad, there is consensus amongst them that the concept of jihad will always include armed struggle against persecution and oppression."
"As important as jihad was, it was/is not considered one of the ""pillars of Islam""."
" According to one scholar (Majid Khadduri, this is most likely because unlike the pillars of the faith (statement of faith, prayer, fasting, charitable giving, Hajj pilgrimage), jihad was a ""collective obligation"" of the whole Muslim community (meaning that ""if the duty is fulfilled by a part of the community it ceases to be obligatory on others""), and was to be carried out by the Islamic state."
" This was the belief of ""all jurists, with almost no exception"", but did not apply to defense of the Muslim community from a sudden attack, in which case jihad was and ""individual obligation"" of all believers, including women and children."
"In the early era that inspired classical Islam (Rashidun Caliphate) and lasted less than a century, jihad spread the realm of Islam to include millions of subjects, and an area extending ""from the borders of India and China to the Pyrenees and the Atlantic""."
 The two empires impeding the advance of Islam were the Persian Sassanian empire and the Byzantine Empire.
 By 657 the Persian empire was conquered and by 661 the Byzantine empire was reduced to a fraction of its former size.
" Medieval Arabic authors believed the conquests were commanded by God, and presented them as orderly and disciplined, under the command of the caliph."
" Many modern historians question whether hunger and desertification, rather than jihad, was a motivating force in the conquests."
" The famous historian William Montgomery Watt argued that ""Most of the participants in the [early Islamic] expeditions probably thought of nothing more than booty ."
" Jurji argues that the motivations of the Arab conquests were certainly not ""for the propagation of Islam ."
" Military advantage, economic desires, [and] the attempt to strengthen the hand of the state and enhance its sovereignty ."
""" Some recent explanations cite both material and religious causes in the conquests."
"According to some authors, the more spiritual definitions of jihad developed sometime after the 150 years of jihad wars and Muslim territorial expansion, and particularly after the Mongol invaders sacked Baghdad and overthrew the Abbasid Caliphate."
" The historian Hamilton Gibb states that ""in the historic [Muslim] Community the concept of jihad had gradually weakened and at length it had been largely reinterpreted in terms of Sufi ethics."
"""Islamic scholar Rudolph Peters also wrote that with the stagnation of Islamic expansionism, the concept of jihad became internalized as a moral or spiritual struggle."
" Earlier classical works on fiqh emphasized jihad as war for God's religion, Peters found."
" Later Muslims (in this case modernists such as Muhammad Abduh and Rashid Rida) emphasized the defensive aspect of jihad—which was similar to the Western concept of a ""just war""."
" Today, some Muslim authors only recognize wars fought for the purpose of territorial defense as well as wars fought for the defense of religious freedom as legitimate."
"Bernard Lewis states that while most Islamic theologians in the classical period (750–1258 CE) understood jihad to be a military endeavor, after Islamic conquest stagnated and the caliphate broke up into smaller states the ""irresistible and permanent jihad came to an end""."
" As jihad became unfeasible it was ""postponed from historic to messianic time."
""" Even when the Ottoman Empire carried on a new holy war of expansion in the seventeenth century, ""the war was not universally pursued""."
"When the Ottoman caliph called for a ""Great Jihad"" by all Muslims against Allied powers during World War I, there were hopes and fears that non-Turkish Muslims would side with Ottoman Turkey, but the appeal did not ""[unite] the Muslim world"", and Muslims did not turn on their non-Muslim commanders in the Allied forces."
" (The war led to the end of the caliphate as the Ottoman Empire entered on the side of the war's losers and surrendered by agreeing to ""viciously punitive"" conditions."
" These were overturned by the popular war hero Mustafa Kemal, who was also a secularist and later abolished the caliphate."
"With the Islamic revival, a new ""fundamentalist"" movement arose, with some different interpretations of Islam, which often placed an increased emphasis on jihad."
" The Wahhabi movement which spread across the Arabian peninsula starting in the 18th century, emphasized jihad as armed struggle."
" Wars against colonialist powers were often declared to be jihad: the Senussi religious order declared jihad against Italian control of Libya in 1912, and the ""Mahdi"" in the Sudan declared jihad against both the British and the Egyptians in 1881."
"Other 19th and 20th century conflicts involving jihad include:
"
Basmachi Movement (1916–1934)The so-called Fulbe jihad states and a few other jihad states in West Africa were established by a series of offensive wars in the 19th century.
" The most powerful, the Sokoto Caliphate, lasted about a century until being incorporated into Colonial Nigeria in 1903."
"In the 20th century, many Islamist groups appeared, being strongly influenced by the social frustrations following the economic crises of the 1970s and 1980s."
" One of the first Islamist groups, the Muslim Brotherhood, emphasized physical struggle and martyrdom in its creed: ""God is our objective; the Quran is our constitution; the Prophet is our leader; struggle (jihad) is our way; and death for the sake of God is the highest of our aspirations."
""" In a tract On Jihad, founder Hassan al-Banna warned readers against ""the widespread belief among many Muslims"" that struggles of the heart were more demanding than struggles with a sword, and called on Egyptians to prepare for jihad against the British Empire, (making him the first influential scholar since the 1857 India uprising to call for jihad of the sword)."
" The group called for jihad against the new state of Israel in the 1940s, and its Palestinian branch, Hamas, called for jihad against Israel when the First Intifada started."
"In 2012, its General Guide (leader) in Egypt, Mohammed Badie also declared jihad ""to save Jerusalem from the usurpers and to [liberate] Palestine from the claws of occupation ."
""" Muslims ""must participate in jihad by [donating] money or [sacrificing] their life ."
""" Many other prominent figures in global jihad started with militancy in the Muslim Brotherhood—Abdullah Azzam, Osama bin Laden's mentor, started in the Muslim Brotherhood of Jordan; Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden's deputy, joined the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 14; and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who planned the September 11 attacks of 2001, claims to have joined the Kuwaiti Muslim Brotherhood at age 16."
" DeLong-Bas, the new ""fundamentalist"" movement brought a reinterpretation of Islam and their own writings on jihad."
" These writings tended to be less interested and involved with legal arguments, what the different of schools of Islamic law had to say, or in solutions for all potential situations."
" ""They emphasize more the moral justifications and the underlying ethical values of the rules, than the detailed elaboration of those rules."
""" They also tended to ignore the distinction between Greater and Lesser jihad because it distracted Muslims ""from the development of the combative spirit they believe is required to rid the Islamic world of Western influences""."
"Contemporary Islamic fundamentalists were often influenced by medieval Islamic jurist Ibn Taymiyyah's, and Egyptian journalist Sayyid Qutb's, ideas on jihad."
"the permissibility of overthrowing a ruler who is classified as an unbeliever due to a failure to adhere to Islamic law,
"
"the absolute division of the world into dar al-kufr and dar al-Islam,
"
"the labeling of anyone not adhering to one's particular interpretation of Islam as an unbeliever, and
"
"the call for blanket warfare against Non-Muslims, particularly Jews and Christians."
"Ibn Taymiyyah recognized ""the possibility of a jihad against `heretical` and `deviant` Muslims within dar al-Islam."
 He identified as heretical and deviant Muslims anyone who propagated innovations (bida') contrary to the Quran and Sunna .
 legitimated jihad against anyone who refused to abide by Islamic law or revolted against the true Muslim authorities.
"He used a very ""broad definition"" of what constituted aggression or rebellion against Muslims, which would make jihad ""not only permissible but necessary."
""" Ibn Taymiyyah also paid careful and lengthy attention to the questions of martyrdom and the benefits of jihad: 'It is in jihad that one can live and die in ultimate happiness, both in this world and in the Hereafter."
 Abandoning it means losing entirely or partially both kinds of happiness.
"The highly influential Muslim Brotherhood leader, Sayyid Qutb, preached in his book Milestones that jihad, `is not a temporary phase but a permanent war ."
 Jihad for freedom cannot cease until the Satanic forces are put to an end and the religion is purified for God in toto.
"` Like Ibn Taymiyya, Qutb focused on martyrdom and jihad, but he added the theme of the treachery and enmity towards Islam of Christians and especially Jews."
" If non-Muslims were waging a ""war against Islam"", jihad against them was not offensive but defensive."
" He also insisted that Christians and Jews were mushrikeen (not monotheists) because (he alleged) gave their priests or rabbis ""authority to make laws, obeying laws which were made by them [and] not permitted by God"" and ""obedience to laws and judgments is a sort of worship""."
"Also influential was the Egyptian Islamist and theorist Muhammad abd-al-Salam Faraj, who wrote the pamphlet Al-Farida al-gha'iba (""The Neglected Duty"")."
" While Qutb felt that jihad was a proclamation of ""liberation for humanity"", Faraj stressed that jihad would enable Muslims to rule the world and to reestablish the caliphate."
" He emphasized the importance of fighting the ""near enemy""—Muslim rulers that he deemed to be apostates, such as the president of Egypt, Anwar Sadat, whom his group assassinated—rather than the traditional enemy, Israel."
" Faraj believed that if Muslims followed their duty and waged jihad, ultimately supernatural divine intervention would provide the victory (a belief he based on Quran 9:14):
"
This means that a Muslim has first of all the duty to execute the command to fight with his own hands.
 [Once he has done so] God will then intervene [and change] the laws of nature.
 In this way victory will be achieved through the hands of the believers by means of God's [intervention].
"Faraj included deceiving the enemy, lying to him, attacking by night (even if it leads to accidentally killing innocents), and felling and burning trees of the infidel, as Islamically legitimate methods of fighting."
" Although Faraj was executed in 1982 for his part in the assassination of Egyptian president Anwar Sadat, his pamphlet and ideas were highly influential, at least among Egyptian Islamist extremist groups."
" (In 1993, for example, 1106 persons were killed or wounded in terror attacks in Egypt."
" More police (120) than terrorists (111) were killed that year and ""several senior police officials and their bodyguards were shot dead in daylight ambushes."
""") Ayman al-Zawahiri, later the #2 person in al-Qaeda, was Faraj's friend and followed his strategy of targeting the ""near enemy"" for many years."
"In the 1980s the Muslim Brotherhood cleric Abdullah Azzam, sometimes called ""the father of the modern global jihad"", opened the possibility of successfully waging jihad against unbelievers in the here and now."
"Azzam issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, declaring it an individual obligation for all able bodied Muslims because it was a defensive jihad to repel invaders."
 His fatwa was endorsed by a number of clerics including leading Saudi clerics such as Sheikh Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz.
"Azzam claimed that ""anyone who looks into the state of Muslims today will find that their great misfortune is their abandonment of Jihad"", and he also warned that ""without Jihad, shirk (joining partners with Allah) will spread and become dominant""."
" Jihad was so important that to ""repel"" the unbelievers was ""the most important obligation after Iman [faith]""."
"Azzam also argued for a broader interpretation of who it was permissible to kill in jihad, an interpretation that some think may have influenced some of his students, including Osama bin Laden."
"Many Muslims know about the hadith in which the Prophet ordered his companions not to kill any women or children, etc."
", but very few know that there are exceptions to this case ."
" In summary, Muslims do not have to stop an attack on mushrikeen, if non-fighting women and children are present."
"A charismatic speaker, Azzam traveled to dozens of cities in Europe and North American to encourage support for jihad in Afghanistan."
" He inspired young Muslims with stories of miraculous deeds during jihad—mujahideen who defeated vast columns of Soviet troops virtually single-handed, who had been run over by tanks but survived, who were shot but unscathed by bullets."
" Angels were witnessed riding into battle on horseback, and falling bombs were intercepted by birds, which raced ahead of the jets to form a protective canopy over the warriors."
"In Afghanistan he set up a ""services office"" for foreign fighters and with support from his former student Osama bin Laden and Saudi charities, foreign mujahideed or would-be mujahideen were provided for."
" Between 1982 and 1992 an estimated 35,000 individual Muslim volunteers went to Afghanistan to fight the Soviets and their Afghan regime."
 Thousands more attended frontier schools teeming with former and future fighters.
 Saudi Arabia and the other conservative Gulf monarchies also provided considerable financial support to the jihad—$600 million a year by 1982.
 CIA also funded Azzam's Maktab al-Khidamat and others via Operation Cyclone.
"Azzam saw Afghanistan as the beginning of jihad to repel unbelievers from many countries—the southern Soviet Republics of Central Asia, Bosnia, the Philippines, Kashmir, Somalia, Eritrea, Spain, and especially his home country of Palestine."
" The defeat of the Soviets in Afghanistan is said to have ""amplified the jihadist tendency from a fringe phenomenon to a major force in the Muslim world."
"""Having tasted victory in Afghanistan, many of the thousands of fighters returned to their home country such as Egypt, Algeria, Kashmir or to places like Bosnia to continue jihad."
" Not all the former fighters agreed with Azzam's chioice of targets (Azzam was assassinated in November 1989) but former Afghan fighters led or participated in serious insurgencies in Egypt, Algeria, Kashmir, Somalia in the 1990s and later creating a ""transnational jihadist stream."
"""In February 1998, Osama bin Laden put a ""Declaration of the World Islamic Front for Jihad against the Jews and the Crusaders"" in the Al-Quds al-Arabi newspaper."
" On 11 September 2001, four passenger planes were hijacked in the United States and crashed, destroying the World Trade Center and damaging the Pentagon."
"In Shia Islam, Jihad is one of the ten Practices of the Religion, (though not one of the five pillars)."
" Traditionally, Twelver Shi'a doctrine has differed from that of Sunni Islam on the concept of jihad, with jihad being ""seen as a lesser priority"" in Shia theology and ""armed activism"" by Shias being ""limited to a person's immediate geography""."
"Twelver Shia doctrine teaches that offensive Jihad can only be carried out under the leadership of Mahdi, who is believed to return from occultation."
" However, ""struggles to defend Islam"" are permissible before his return."
"At least one important contemporary Twelver Shia figure, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian Revolution and the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, wrote a treatise on the ""Greater Jihad"" (i."
"Because of their history of being oppressed, Shias also associated jihad with certain passionate features, notably in the remembrance of Ashura."
"In Islamic tradition jihad or the struggle in the way of God, whether as armed struggle, or any form of opposition of the wrong, is generally regarded as one of the essential requirements of a person's faith as a Muslim."
" Shi'î tradition carried this requirement a step further, making jihad one of the pillars or foundations (arkan) of religion."
" If, therefore, Husayn's struggle against the Umayyad regime must be regarded as an act of jihad, then, In the mind of devotees, the participation of the community in his suffering and its ascent to the truth of his message must also be regarded as an extension of the holy struggle of the Imam himself."
 The hadith from which we took the title of this chapter states this point very clearly.
" Ja'far al-Sadiq is said to have declared to al-Mufaddal, one of his closest disciples, 'The sigh of the sorrowful for the wrong done us is an act of praise (tasbih) [of God], his sorrow for us is an act of worship, and his keeping of our secret is a struggle (jihad) in the way of God'; the Imâm then added, 'This hadith should be inscribed in letters of gold'."
"Hence, the concept of jihad (holy struggle) gained a deeper and more personal meaning."
" Whether through weeping, the composition and recitation of poetry, showing compassion and doing good to the poor or carrying arms, the Shi'i Muslim saw himself helping the Imam in his struggle against the wrong  (zulm) and gaining for himself the same merit (thawab) of those who actually fought and died for him."
" The ta'ziyah, in its broader sense the sharing of the entire life of the suffering family of Muhammad, has become for the Shi'i community the true meaning of compassion."
"Jihad has been called for by Shia Islamists in the 20th century, notably Ruhollah Khomeini declared jihad on Iraq during the Iran–Iraq War, and the Shia bombers of Western embassies and peacekeeping troops in Lebanon called themselves, ""Islamic Jihad""."
" Prior to the Iranian revolution in 1922, the Shiite cleric Mehdi Al-Khalissi issued a fatwa calling upon Iraqis not to participate in the Iraqi elections, as the Iraqi government was established by foreign powers."
" Between 1918 and 1919 in the Shia holy city of Najaf the League of the Islamic Awakening was established by several religious scholars, tribal chiefs, and landlords assassinated a British officer in the hopes of sparking a similar rebellion in Karbala which is also regarded as sacred for Shias."
"By the start of the revolt itself in 1920, Grand Ayatollah Muhammad Taqi Shirazi the father of Mohammad al-Husayni al-Shirazi and grandfather of Sadiq Hussaini Shirazi, declared through a Fatwa, that it was not permissible or acceptable for Muslims to be ruled by non-Muslims and called for Jihad against European powers in the Middle East."
"During the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, despite being a predominantly Sunni nation, Afghanistan's Shiite population took arms against the Communist government and allied Soviet forces like the nation's Sunnis and were collectively referred to as the Afghan Mujahideen."
 Shiite Jihadists in Afghanistan were known as the Tehran Eight and received support from the Iranian government in fighting against the Communist Afghan government and allied Soviet forces in Afghanistan.
"After the 2003 invasion of Iraq a number of Sunni and Shiite armed group emerged, including Kataib Hezbollah, the Mehdi Army led by Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, and the Soldiers of Heaven led by Dia Abdul Zahra Kadim, who also claimed to be the returning Mehdi."
" In 2007 fighting broke out between Kadim's movement and the Iraqi Army as well as supporting American soldiers, after the Iraqi government claimed to have discovered a plot to assassinate Ali al-Sistani, who is considered influential, along with other Shiite clerics to cause as much chaos as possible in line with the beliefs of the Soldiers of Heaven, that causing chaos would usher the apocalypse, during the battle 200 of Kadim's followers, and Kadim himself were killed by American and Iraqi forces."
"According to The National, this changed with the Syrian Civil War, where, ""for the first time in the history of Shia Islam, adherents are seeping into another country to fight in a holy war to defend their doctrine."
""" Thus, Shia and Sunni fighters are waging jihad against each other in Syria."
"In 2004 the Shiite Houthi Movement, also known as Ansar Allah, began an insurgency in northern Yemen against the Yemeni government led by Ali Abdullah Saleh."
" The movement was founded in the 1990s as a Zaydi revivalist movement by Hussein Badreddin al-Houthi who believed his movement served to defend Islam; he had also lived in Iran for a period of time, and held Iran's supreme leader Ruhollah Khomeini in high regard, and a former parliament member part of the Islamist Party of Truth, as the Believing Youth."
 The group was taken over by Hussein's son Abdul Malik al-Houthi after Hussein's death in 2004.
" Under Abdul Malik's leadership the group partly seized control of the country initiating a civil war in Yemen, causing the Yemeni government to request assistance from Saudi Arabia to fight the Houthis in 2015."
" Since the start of the civil war in 2015, the Houthis have recruited 50,000 child soldiers in doing so, the group promotes Jihad as part of their ideology as well as their recruitment."
 As of 2017 the İmam Hatip schools offer lessons about the Jihad as a religious concept.
" The Speaker of the Turkish Parliament, Ismail Kahraman, called the Operation Olive Branch against the Kurdish YPG in Afrin a Jihad."
"Some observers have noted the evolution in the rules of jihad—from the original ""classical"" doctrine to that of 21st century Salafi jihadism."
" According to the legal historian Sadarat Kadri, during the last couple of centuries, incremental changes in Islamic legal doctrine (developed by Islamists who otherwise condemn any bid‘ah (innovation) in religion), have ""normalized"" what was once ""unthinkable""."
" ""The very idea that Muslims might blow themselves up for God was unheard of before 1983, and it was not until the early 1990s that anyone anywhere had tried to justify killing innocent Muslims who were not on a battlefield."
"""The first or the ""classical"" doctrine of jihad which was developed towards the end of the 8th century, emphasized the jihad of the sword (jihad bil-saif) rather than the ""jihad of the heart"", but it contained many legal restrictions which were developed from interpretations of both the Quran and the Hadith, such as detailed rules involving ""the initiation, the conduct, the termination"" of jihad, the treatment of prisoners, the distribution of booty, etc."
" Unless there was a sudden attack on the Muslim community, jihad was not a ""personal obligation"" (fard ayn); instead it was a ""collective one"" (fard al-kifaya), which had to be discharged ""in the way of God"" (fi sabil Allah), and it could only be directed by the caliph, ""whose discretion over its conduct was all but absolute."
""" (This was designed in part to avoid incidents like the Kharijia's jihad against and killing of Caliph Ali, since they deemed that he was no longer a Muslim)."
" Martyrdom resulting from an attack on the enemy with no concern for your own safety was praiseworthy, but dying by your own hand (as opposed to the enemy's) merited a special place in Hell."
" The category of jihad which is considered to be a collective obligation is sometimes simplified as ""offensive jihad"" in Western texts."
"Based on the 20th century interpretations of Sayyid Qutb, Abdullah Azzam, Ruhollah Khomeini, al-Qaeda and others, many if not all of those self-proclaimed jihad fighters believe that defensive global jihad is a personal obligation, which means that no caliph or Muslim head of state needs to declare it."
" Killing yourself in the process of killing the enemy is an act of martyrdom and it brings you a special place in Heaven, not a special place in Hell; and the killing of Muslim bystanders (never mind Non-Muslims), should not impede acts of jihad."
" Military and intelligent analyst Sebastian Gorka described the new interpretation of jihad as the ""willful targeting of civilians by a non-state actor through unconventional means."
"""Islamic theologian Abu Abdullah al-Muhajir has been identified as the key theorist and ideologue behind modern jihadist violence."
" His theological and legal justifications influenced Abu Musab al-Zarqawi of al-Qaeda as well as several jihadi terrorist groups, including ISIS."
" Zarqawi used a manuscript of al-Muhajir's ideas at AQI training camps that were later deployed by ISIS, referred to as The Jurisprudence of Jihad or The Jurisprudence of Blood."
"The book has been described as rationalising ""the murder of non-combatants"" by The Guardian's Mark Towsend, citing Salah al-Ansari of Quilliam, who notes: ""There is a startling lack of study and concern regarding this abhorrent and dangerous text [The Jurisprudence of Blood] in almost all Western and Arab scholarship""."
" Charlie Winter of The Atlantic describes it as a ""theological playbook used to justify the group's abhorrent acts""."
"Ranging from ruminations on the merits of beheading, torturing, or burning prisoners to thoughts on assassination, siege warfare, and the use of biological weapons, Muhajir’s intellectual legacy is a crucial component of the literary corpus of ISIS—and, indeed, whatever comes after it—a way to render practically anything permissible, provided, that is, it can be spun as beneficial to the jihad."
"] According to Muhajir, committing suicide to kill people is not only a theologically sound act, but a commendable one, too, something to be cherished and celebrated regardless of its outcome."
"] neither Zarqawi nor his inheritors have looked back, liberally using Muhajir’s work to normalize the use of suicide tactics in the time since, such that they have become the single most important military and terrorist method—defensive or offensive—used by ISIS today."
 The way that Muhajir theorized it was simple—he offered up a theological fix that allows any who desire it to sidestep the Koranic injunctions against suicide.
" Stout also discusses the al Muhajir-inspired text in his book, Terrorism, Political Violence, and Extremism."
" He assesses that jihadists regard their actions as being ""for the greater good""; that they are in a ""weakened in the earth"" situation that renders terrorism a valid means of solution."
The term 'jihad' has accrued both violent and non-violent meanings.
" According to John Esposito, it can simply mean striving to live a moral and virtuous life, spreading and defending Islam as well as fighting injustice and oppression, among other things."
 The relative importance of these two forms of jihad is a matter of controversy.
"According to scholar of Islam and Islamic history Rudoph Peters, in the contemporary Muslim world,
"
"Traditionalist Muslims look to classical works on ""fiqh"" in their writings on jihad, and ""copy phrases"" from those;
"
"Islamic Modernists ""emphasize the defensive aspect of jihad, regarding it as tantamount to bellum justum in modern international law; and
"
"Islamist/revivalists/fundamentalists (Abul Ala Maududi, Sayyid Qutb, Abdullah Azzam, etc."
) view it as a struggle for the expansion of Islam and the realization of Islamic ideals.
"A poll by Gallup showed that a ""significant majority"" of Muslim Indonesians define the term to mean ""sacrificing one's life for the sake of Islam/God/a just cause"" or ""fighting against the opponents of Islam""."
" In Lebanon, Kuwait, Jordan, and Morocco, the most frequent responses included references to ""duty toward God"", a ""divine duty"", or a ""worship of God"", with no militaristic connotations."
 The terminology is also applied to the fight for women's liberation.
" Other responses referenced, in descending order of prevalence:
"
"""A commitment to hard work"" and ""achieving one's goals in life""
"
"""Promoting peace, harmony or cooperation, and assisting others""
"
"=== Distinction between the ""greater"" and ""lesser"" jihad ===
"
"In his work, The History of Baghdad, Al-Khatib al-Baghdadi, an 11th-century Islamic scholar, referenced a statement by the companion of Muhammad Jabir ibn Abd-Allah."
" The reference stated that Jabir said, ""We have returned from the lesser jihad (al-jihad al-asghar) to the greater jihad (al-jihad al-akbar)."
""" When asked, ""What is the greater jihad?,"" he replied, ""It is the struggle against oneself."
""" This reference gave rise to the distinguishing of two forms of jihad: ""greater"" and ""lesser""."
"The hadith does not appear in any of the authoritative collections, and according to the Muslim Jurist Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani, the source of the quote is unreliable:
"
This saying is widespread and it is a saying by Ibrahim ibn Ablah according to Nisa'i in al-Kuna.
 Ghazali mentions it in the Ihya' and al-`Iraqi said that Bayhaqi related it on the authority of Jabir and said: There is weakness in its chain of transmission.
"—Hajar al Asqalani, Tasdid al-qaws; see also Kashf al-Khafaa’ (no."
"Contemporary jihadist scholar Abdullah Azzam attacked it as ""a false, fabricated hadith which has no basis."
" It is only a saying of Ibrahim Ibn Abi `Abalah, one of the Successors, and it contradicts textual evidence and reality."
"""The concept has had ""enormous influence"" in Islamic mysticism (Sufism)."
"Hanbali scholar Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya believed that ""internal Jihad"" is important but suggests those hadith which consider ""Jihad of the heart/soul"" to be more important than ""Jihad by the sword"", are weak."
" Ayoud states that ""The goal of true jihad is to attain a harmony between Islam (submission), iman (faith), and ihsan (righteous living)."
""" Jihad is a process encompassing both individual and social reform, this is called jihad fi sabil allah (""struggle in the way of God""), and can be undertaken by the means of the Quran (jihad bi-al-qur'an)."
" According to Ayoud the greatest Jihad is the struggle of every Muslim against the social, moral, and political evils."
" However, depending on social and political circumstances, Jihad may be regarded as a sixth fundamental obligation (farid) incumbent on the entire Muslim community (ummah) when their integrity is in danger, in this case jihad becomes an ""absolute obligation"" (fard 'ayn), or when social and religious reform is gravely hampered."
" Otherwise it is a ""limited obligation"" (fard kifayah), incumbent upon those who are directly involved."
" These rules apply to armed struggle or ""jihad of the sword""."
"In modern times, Pakistani scholar and professor Fazlur Rahman Malik has used the term to describe the struggle to establish a ""just moral-social order"", while President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia has used it to describe the struggle for economic development in that country."
"According to the BBC, a third meaning of jihad is the struggle to build a good society."
" In a commentary of the hadith Sahih Muslim, entitled al-Minhaj, the medieval Islamic scholar Yahya ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi stated that ""one of the collective duties of the community as a whole (fard kifaya) is to lodge a valid protest, to solve problems of religion, to have knowledge of Divine Law, to command what is right and forbid wrong conduct""."
"Majid Khadduri and Ibn Rushd lists four kinds of jihad fi sabilillah (struggle in the cause of God):
"
Jihad of the heart (jihad bil qalb/nafs) is concerned with combatting the devil and in the attempt to escape his persuasion to evil.
 This type of Jihad was regarded as the greater jihad (al-jihad al-akbar).
"Jihad by the tongue (jihad bil lisan) (also Jihad by the word, jihad al-qalam) is concerned with speaking the truth and spreading the word of Islam with one's tongue."
Jihad by the hand (jihad bil yad) refers to choosing to do what is right and to combat injustice and what is wrong with action.
"Jihad by the sword (jihad bis saif) refers to qital fi sabilillah (armed fighting in the way of God, or holy war), the most common usage by Salafi Muslims and offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood."
" Delong-Bas lists a number of types of ""jihad"" that have been proposed by Muslims
"
"missionary jihad or calling the people to Islam (jihad al-da'wah)Other ""types"" mentioned include
"
"""Economic"" Jihad (good doing involving money such as spending within one's means, helping the ""poor and the downtrodden"") (President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia, used jihad to describe the struggle for economic development in Tunisia."
"Jihad Al-Nikah, or sexual jihad, ""refers to women joining the jihad by offering sex to fighters to boost their morale""."
" The term originated from a fatwa believed to have been fabricated by the Syrian government in order to discredit its opponents, and the prevalence of this phenomenon has been disputed."
"Usage by some non-MuslimsThe United States Department of Justice has used its own ad hoc definitions of jihad in indictments of individuals involved in terrorist activities:
"
"""As used in this First Superseding Indictment, 'Jihad' is the Arabic word meaning 'holy war'."
" In this context, jihad refers to the use of violence, including paramilitary action against persons, governments deemed to be enemies of the fundamentalist version of Islam."
"""As used in this Superseding Indictment, 'violent jihad' or 'jihad' include planning, preparing for, and engaging in, acts of physical violence, including murder, maiming, kidnapping, and hostage-taking."
""" in the indictment against several individuals including José Padilla."
"""Fighting and warfare might sometimes be necessary, but it was only a minor part of the whole jihad or struggle,"" according to Karen Armstrong."
"""Jihad is a propagandistic device which, as need be, resorts to armed struggle—two ingredients common to many ideological movements,"" according to Maxime Rodinson."
" Barber used the term Jihad to point out the resistant movement by fundamentalist ethnic groups who want to protect their traditions, heritage and identity from globalization (which he refers to as 'McWorld')."
"Fred Donner states that, whether the Quran only sanctions defensive warfare or whether it commands the waging of an all-out war against non-Muslims depends on the interpretation of the relevant passages."
" According to Albrecht Noch, the Qur'an does not explicitly state the aims of the war which Muslims are obliged to wage; rather the passages concerning jihad aim to promote fighters for the Islamic cause and they do not discuss military ethics."
" However, according to the majority of jurists, the Qur'anic casus belli (justifications for war) are restricted to aggression against Muslims, and fitna—persecution of Muslims because of their religious belief."
 They hold that unbelief in itself is not a justification for war.
" These jurists therefore maintain that only combatants are to be fought; noncombatants such as women, children, clergy, the aged, the insane, farmers, serfs, the blind, and so on are not to be killed in war."
" Thus, the Hanafī Ibn Najīm states: ""the reason for jihād in our [the Hanafīs] view is kawnuhum harbā ‛alaynā [literally, their being at war against us]."
""" The Hanafī jurists al-Shaybānī and al-Sarakhsī state that ""although kufr [unbelief in God] is one of the greatest sins, it is between the individual and his God the Almighty and the punishment for this sin is to be postponed to the dār al-jazā’, (the abode of reckoning, the Hereafter)."
"""In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the names of many militant groups included the word ""jihad"":

"Controversy has arisen over whether the usage of the term jihad without further explanation refers to military combat, and whether some have used confusion over the definition of the term to their advantage."
"According to a Gallup survey, which asked Muslims in several countries what jihad meant to them, responses such as ""sacrificing one's life for the sake of Islam/God/a just cause"" and ""fighting against the opponents of Islam"" were the most common type in non-Arab countries (Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, and Indonesia), being given by a majority of respondents in Indonesia."
" In the four Arabic-speaking countries included in the survey (Lebanon, Kuwait, Jordan, and Morocco), the most frequent responses included references to ""duty toward God"", a ""divine duty"", or a ""worship of God"", with no militaristic connotations."
" Gallup's Richard Burkholder concludes from these results that the concept of jihad among Muslims ""is considerably more nuanced than the single sense in which Western commentators invariably invoke the term."
"""Middle East historian Bernard Lewis argues that in the Quran ""jihad ."
" has usually been understood as meaning 'to wage war'"", that for most of the recorded history of Islam, ""from the lifetime of the Prophet Muhammad onward"", jihad was used in a primarily military sense, and that ""the overwhelming majority of classical theologians, jurists, and traditionalists"" (i."
" specialists in hadith) also ""understood the obligation of jihad in a military sense."
"""Historian Douglas Streusand writes that ""in hadith collections, jihad means armed action""."
" In what is probably the most standard collection of hadith, Sahih al-Bukhari, ""the 199 references to jihad all assume that jihad means warfare."
"According to David Cook, author of Understanding JihadIn reading Muslim literature—both contemporary and classical—one can see that the evidence for the primacy of spiritual jihad is negligible."
" Today it is certain that no Muslim, writing in a non-Western language (such as Arabic, Persian, Urdu), would ever make claims that jihad is primarily nonviolent or has been superseded by the spiritual jihad."
" Such claims are made solely by Western scholars, primarily those who study Sufism and/or work in interfaith dialogue, and by Muslim apologists who are trying to present Islam in the most innocuous manner possible."
" Cook argued that ""Presentations along these lines are ideological in tone and should be discounted for their bias and deliberate ignorance of the subject"" and that it ""is no longer acceptable for Western scholars or Muslim apologists writing in non-Muslim languages to make flat, unsupported statements concerning the prevalence—either from a historical point of view or within contemporary Islam—of the spiritual jihad."
"In Ahmadiyya Islam, jihad is primarily one's personal inner struggle and should not be used violently for political motives."
 Violence is the last option only to be used to protect religion and one's own life in extreme situations of persecution.
Quranists do not believe that the word jihad means holy war.
 They believe it can incorporate both military and non-military aspects.
" When it refers to the military aspect, it is understood primarily as defensive warfare."
"Followers of the Baháʼí Faith believe that the law of Jihad has been ""blotted out"" from the scriptures by the reforms set out in the 19th century tablet Bishárát (""Glad Tidings"")."

"Al-Qaeda (; Arabic: القاعدة‎ al-Qāʿidah, IPA: [ælqɑːʕɪdɐ], translation: ""The Base"", ""The Foundation"", alternatively spelled al-Qaida and al-Qa'ida) is a militant Sunni Islamist multi-national terrorist organization founded in 1988 by Osama bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and several other Arab volunteers during the Soviet–Afghan War."
Al-Qaeda operates as a network of Islamic extremists and Salafist jihadists.
" The organization has been designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Security Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Russia, India, and various other countries (see below)."
" Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on non-military and military targets in various countries, including the 1998 United States embassy bombings, the September 11 attacks, and the 2002 Bali bombings."
"The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the ""War on Terror"", which sought to undermine al-Qaeda and its allies."
" The deaths of key leaders, including that of Osama bin Laden, have led al-Qaeda's operations to shift from top-down organization and planning of attacks, to the planning of attacks which are carried out by a loose network of associated groups and lone-wolf operators."
 Al-Qaeda characteristically organises attacks which include suicide attacks and the simultaneous bombing of several targets.
 Al-Qaeda ideologues envision the removal of all foreign influences in Muslim countries.
Al-Qaeda members believe a Christian–Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam.
" As Salafist jihadists, members of al-Qaeda believe that killing non-combatants is religiously sanctioned."
" Al-Qaeda also opposes what it regards as man-made laws, and wants to replace them with a strict form of sharia law."
Al-Qaeda has carried out many attacks on people whom it considers kafir.
 It is also responsible for instigating sectarian violence among Muslims.
" Al-Qaeda regards liberal Muslims, Shias, Sufis and other sects as heretical and its members and sympathizers have attacked their mosques and gatherings."
" Examples of sectarian attacks include the Yazidi community bombings, the Sadr City bombings, the Ashoura massacre and the April 2007 Baghdad bombings."
"Following the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011, the group has been led by Egyptian Ayman al-Zawahiri, and as of 2021 has reportedly suffered from a deterioration of central command over its regional operations."
Al-Qaeda only indirectly controls its day-to-day operations.
" Its philosophy calls for the centralization of decision making, while allowing for the decentralization of execution."
" Al Qaeda's top leaders have defined the organization's ideology and guiding strategy, and they have also articulated simple and easy-to-receive messages."
" At the same time, mid-level organizations were given autonomy, but they had to consult with top management before large-scale attacks and assassinations."
" Top management included the shura council as well as committees on military operations, finance, and information sharing."
" Through Al Qaeda's information committees, he placed special emphasis on communicating with his groups."
" However, after the War on Terror, al-Qaeda's leadership has become isolated."
" As a result, the leadership has become decentralized, and the organization has become regionalized into several al-Qaeda groups."
Many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al-Qaeda's leadership.
" However, bin Laden held considerable ideological sway over some Muslim extremists before his death."
" Experts argue that al-Qaeda has fragmented into a number of disparate regional movements, and that these groups bear little connection with one another."
"This view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview with Tayseer Allouni:
"
" We are the children of an Islamic Nation, with Prophet Muhammad as its leader, our Lord is one ."
" So the situation isn't like the West portrays it, that there is an 'organization' with a specific name (such as 'al-Qa'idah') and so on."
" created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire ."
" So this place was called 'The Base' ['Al-Qa'idah'], as in a training base, so this name grew and became."
" We are the children of a nation, and we are an inseparable part of it, and from those public demonstrations which spread from the far east, from the Philippines to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to India, to Pakistan, reaching Mauritania ."
"Bruce Hoffman, however, sees al-Qaeda as a cohesive network that is strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas."
"The following are presently believed to be indirect affiliates of al-Qaeda:
"
"Osama bin Laden served as the emir of al-Qaeda from the organization's founding in 1988 until his assassination by US forces on May 1, 2011."
" Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011."
"Bin Laden was advised by a Shura Council, which consists of senior al-Qaeda members."
Ayman al-Zawahiri had been al-Qaeda's deputy emir and assumed the role of emir following bin Laden's death.
" Al-Zawahiri replaced Saif al-Adel, who had served as interim commander."
"On June 5, 2012, Pakistani intelligence officials announced that al-Rahman's alleged successor as second in command, Abu Yahya al-Libi, had been killed in Pakistan."
Nasir al-Wuhayshi was alleged to have become al-Qaeda's overall second in command and general manager in 2013.
 He was concurrently the leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) until he was killed by a US airstrike in Yemen in June 2015.
"Abu Khayr al-Masri, Wuhayshi's alleged successor as the deputy to Ayman al-Zawahiri, was killed by a US airstrike in Syria in February 2017."
Al-Qaeda's network was built from scratch as a conspiratorial network which drew upon the leadership of a number of regional nodes.
" The organization divided itself into several committees, which include:
"
"The Military Committee, which is responsible for training operatives, acquiring weapons, and planning attacks."
"The Money/Business Committee, which funds the recruitment and training of operatives through the hawala banking system."
" US-led efforts to eradicate the sources of ""terrorist financing"" were most successful in the year immediately following the September 11 attacks."
" Al-Qaeda continues to operate through unregulated banks, such as the 1,000 or so hawaladars in Pakistan, some of which can handle deals of up to US$10 million."
" The committee also procures false passports, pays al-Qaeda members, and oversees profit-driven businesses."
" In the 9/11 Commission Report, it was estimated that al-Qaeda required $30 million per year to conduct its operations."
"The Law Committee reviews Sharia law, and decides upon courses of action conform to it."
"The Islamic Study/Fatwah Committee issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans."
The Media Committee ran the now-defunct newspaper Nashrat al Akhbar (English: Newscast) and handled public relations.
"In 2005, al-Qaeda formed As-Sahab, a media production house, to supply its video and audio materials."
Most of Al Qaeda's top leaders and operational directors were veterans who fought against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in the 1980s.
" Osama bin Laden and his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahiri, were the leaders who were considered the operational commanders of the organization."
" Nevertheless, Al-Qaeda is not operationally managed by Ayman al-Zawahiri."
" Several operational groups exist, which consult with the leadership in situations where attacks are in preparation."
"When asked in 2005 about the possibility of al-Qaeda's connection to the July 7, 2005 London bombings, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said: ""Al-Qaeda is not an organization."
""" On August 13, 2005, The Independent newspaper, reported that the July 7 bombers had acted independently of an al-Qaeda mastermind."
"Nasser al-Bahri, who was Osama bin Laden's bodyguard for four years in the run-up to 9/11 wrote in his memoir a highly detailed description of how the group functioned at that time."
 Al-Bahri described al-Qaeda's formal administrative structure and vast arsenal.
" However, the author Adam Curtis argued that the idea of al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention."
" Curtis contended the name ""al-Qaeda"" was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the 1998 US embassy bombings in East Africa."
The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy.
 These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance.
" There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term ""al-Qaeda"" to refer to the name of a group until after September 11 attacks, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it."
"During the 2001 trial, the US Department of Justice needed to show that bin Laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him in absentia under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act."
" The name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of Jamal al-Fadl, who said he was a founding member of the group and a former employee of bin Laden."
" Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl's testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a plea bargain agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack US military establishments."
" Sam Schmidt, a defense attorney who defended al-Fadl said:
"
"There were selective portions of al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together."
 I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was.
 It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.
"The number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown."
 Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden's compound in 2011 show that the core al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170.
" In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries."
" As of 2009, it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders."
"According to the 2004 BBC documentary The Power of Nightmares, al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates."
" The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed."
" Al-Qaeda's commanders, as well as its sleeping agents, are hiding in different parts of the world to this day."
 They are mainly hunted by the American and Israeli secret services.
" Al Qaeda's number two leader, Abdullah Ahmed Abdullah, was killed by Israeli agents."
" His pseudonym was Abu Muhammad al-Masri, who was killed in November 2020 in Iran."
 He was involved in the 1988 assassination attempt on the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
"According to author Robert Cassidy, al-Qaeda maintains two separate forces which are deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan."
" The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was ""organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces"" in the Soviet–Afghan war."
 The force was composed primarily of foreign mujahideen from Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
 Many of these fighters went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global jihad.
" Another group, which numbered 10,000 in 2006, live in the West and have received rudimentary combat training."
"Other analysts have described al-Qaeda's rank and file as being ""predominantly Arab"" in its first years of operation, but that the organization also includes ""other peoples"" as of 2007."
 It has been estimated that 62 percent of al-Qaeda members have a university education.
" In 2011 and the following year, the Americans successfully settled accounts with Osama bin Laden, Anwar al-Awlaki, the organization's chief propagandist, and Abu Yahya al-Libi's deputy commander."
 The optimistic voices were already saying it was over for al-Qaeda.
" Nevertheless, it was around this time that the Arab Spring greeted the region, the turmoil of which came great to al-Qaeda's regional forces."
" Seven years later, Ayman al-Zawahiri became arguably the number one leader in the organization, implementing his strategy with systematic consistency."
" Tens of thousands loyal to al-Qaeda and related organizations were able to challenge local and regional stability and ruthlessly attack their enemies in the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe and Russia alike."
" In fact, from Northwest Africa to South Asia, al-Qaeda had more than two dozen “franchise-based” allies."
" The number of al-Qaeda militants was set at 20,000 in Syria alone, and they had 4,000 members in Yemen and about 7,000 in Somalia."
"Al-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers."
" In the 1990s, financing came partly from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden."
" Other sources of income included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic Gulf states."
" A WikiLeaks-released 2009 internal US government cable stated that ""terrorist funding emanating from Saudi Arabia remains a serious concern."
"""Among the first pieces of evidence regarding Saudi Arabia's support for al-Qaeda was the so-called ""Golden Chain"", a list of early al-Qaeda funders seized during a 2002 raid in Sarajevo by Bosnian police."
" The hand-written list was validated by al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl, and included the names of both donors and beneficiaries."
" Osama bin-Laden's name appeared seven times among the beneficiaries, while 20 Saudi and Gulf-based businessmen and politicians were listed among the donors."
" Notable donors included Adel Batterjee, and Wael Hamza Julaidan."
" Batterjee was designated as a terror financier by the US Department of the Treasury in 2004, and Julaidan is recognized as one of al-Qaeda's founders."
Documents seized during the 2002 Bosnia raid showed that al-Qaeda widely exploited charities to channel financial and material support to its operatives across the globe.
" Notably, this activity exploited the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) and the Muslim World League (MWL)."
" The IIRO had ties with al-Qaeda associates worldwide, including al-Qaeda's deputy Ayman al Zawahiri."
 Zawahiri's brother worked for the IIRO in Albania and had actively recruited on behalf of al-Qaeda.
 The MWL was openly identified by al-Qaeda's leader as one of the three charities al-Qaeda primarily relied upon for funding sources.
Several Qatari citizens have been accused of funding al-Qaeda.
" This includes Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi, a Qatari citizen and a human-rights activist who founded the Swiss-based non-governmental organization (NGO) Alkarama."
" On December 18, 2013, the US Treasury designated Nuaimi as a terrorist for his activities supporting al-Qaeda."
" The US Treasury has said Nuaimi ""has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qaeda in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qaeda in Iraq and Qatar-based donors""."
Nuaimi was accused of overseeing a $2 million monthly transfer to al-Qaeda in Iraq as part of his role as mediator between Iraq-based al-Qaeda senior officers and Qatari citizens.
" Nuaimi allegedly entertained relationships with Abu-Khalid al-Suri, al-Qaeda's top envoy in Syria, who processed a $600,000 transfer to al-Qaeda in 2013."
" Nuaimi is also known to be associated with Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani, a Yemeni politician and founding member of Alkarama, who was listed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT) by the US Treasury in 2013."
 The US authorities claimed that Humayqani exploited his role in Alkarama to fundraise on behalf of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).
" A prominent figure in AQAP, Nuaimi was also reported to have facilitated the flow of funding to AQAP affiliates based in Yemen."
 Nuaimi was also accused of investing funds in the charity directed by Humayqani to ultimately fund AQAP.
" About ten months after being sanctioned by the US Treasury, Nuaimi was also restrained from doing business in the UK."
"Another Qatari citizen, Kalifa Mohammed Turki Subayi, was sanctioned by the US Treasury on June 5, 2008, for his activities as a ""Gulf-based al-Qaeda financier""."
 Subayi's name was added to the UN Security Council's Sanctions List in 2008 on charges of providing financial and material support to al-Qaeda senior leadership.
 Subayi allegedly moved al-Qaeda recruits to South Asia-based training camps.
" He also financially supported Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani national and senior al-Qaeda officer who is believed to be the mastermind behind the September 11 attack according to the September 11 Commission report."
"Qataris provided support to al-Qaeda through the country's largest NGO, the Qatar Charity."
" Al-Qaeda defector al-Fadl, who was a former member of Qatar Charity, testified in court that Abdullah Mohammed Yusef, who served as Qatar Charity's director, was affiliated to al-Qaeda and simultaneously to the National Islamic Front, a political group that gave al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden harbor in Sudan in the early 1990s."
 Arnaout revealed that Qatar Charity was cited by Bin Laden in 1993 as one of the charities used to channel financial support to al-Qaeda operatives overseas.
 The same documents also report Bin Laden's complaint that the failed assassination attempt of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had compromised the ability of al-Qaeda to exploit charities to support its operatives to the extent it was capable of before 1995.
It is alleged that the Qatar Charity gave financial support to members of al-Qaeda in Chechnya.
 This accusation was publicly denied by Hamad bin Nasser al-Thani.
" Qatar Charity is among the NGOs allegedly channelling funds to Ansar Dine in North Mali, according to French military intelligence reports from France's intervention in the country in early 2013."
"Qatar financed al-Qaeda's enterprises through al-Qaeda's former affiliate in Syria, Jabhat al-Nusra."
 The funding was primarily channeled through kidnapping for ransom.
 The Consortium Against Terrorist Finance (CATF) reported that the Gulf country has funded al-Nusra since 2013.
" In 2017, Asharq Al-Awsat estimated that Qatar had disbursed $25 million in support of al-Nusra through kidnapping for ransom."
" In addition, Qatar has launched fundraising campaigns on behalf of al-Nusra."
" Al-Nusra acknowledged a Qatar-sponsored campaign ""as one of the preferred conduits for donations intended for the group""."
"In the disagreement over whether Al-Qaeda's objectives are religious or political, Mark Sedgwick describes Al-Qaeda's strategy as political in the immediate term but with ultimate aims that are religious."
"On March 11, 2005, Al-Quds Al-Arabi published extracts from Saif al-Adel's document ""Al Qaeda's Strategy to the Year 2020""."
" Abdel Bari Atwan summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the Ummah from all forms of oppression:
"
Provoke the United States and the West into invading a Muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on US soil that results in massive civilian casualties.
Expand the conflict to neighboring countries and engage the US and its allies in a long war of attrition.
"Convert al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against the US and countries allied with the US until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the 2004 Madrid train bombings, but which did not have the same effect with the July 7, 2005 London bombings."
"The US economy will finally collapse by the year 2020, under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places."
" This will lead to a collapse in the worldwide economic system, and lead to global political instability."
" This will lead to a global jihad led by al-Qaeda, and a Wahhabi Caliphate will then be installed across the world."
"Atwan noted that, while the plan is unrealistic, ""it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the downfall of the Soviet Union."
"""According to Fouad Hussein, a Jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with Al-Zarqawi, Al Qaeda's strategy consists of seven phases and is similar to the plan described in Al Qaeda's Strategy to the year 2020."
 The goal of the phase is to provoke the United States to attack a Muslim country by executing an attack that kills many civilians on US soil.
 The goal of this phase was to recruit young men to the cause and to transform the al-Qaeda group into a movement.
 Iraq was supposed to become the center of all operations with financial and military support for bases in other states.
"""Arising and Standing up"", was supposed to last from 2007 to 2010."
" In this phase, al-Qaeda wanted to execute additional attacks and focus their attention on Syria."
 Hussein believed other countries in the Arabian Peninsula were also in danger.
Al-Qaeda expected a steady growth among their ranks and territories due to the declining power of the regimes in the Arabian Peninsula.
" The main focus of attack in this phase was supposed to be on oil suppliers and cyberterrorism, targeting the US economy and military infrastructure."
"The declaration of an Islamic Caliphate, which was projected between 2013 and 2016."
" In this phase, al-Qaeda expected the resistance from Israel to be heavily reduced."
"The declaration of an ""Islamic Army"" and a ""fight between believers and non-believers"", also called ""total confrontation""."
"According to the seven-phase strategy, the war is projected to last less than two years."
"According to Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute and Katherine Zimmerman of the American Enterprise Institute, the new model of al-Qaeda is to ""socialize communities"" and build a broad territorial base of operations with the support of local communities, also gaining income independent of the funding of sheiks."
"The English name of the organization is a simplified transliteration of the Arabic noun al-qāʿidah (‏القاعدة‎), which means ""the foundation"" or ""the base""."
" The initial al- is the Arabic definite article ""the"", hence ""the base""."
" However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name are not phones found in the English language, the common naturalized English pronunciations include ,  and ."
" Al-Qaeda's name can also be transliterated as al-Qaida, al-Qa'ida, or el-Qaida."
"Bin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with Al Jazeera journalist Tayseer Alouni in October 2001:
"
The name 'al-Qaeda' was established a long time ago by mere chance.
 The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against Russia's terrorism.
It has been argued that two documents seized from the Sarajevo office of the Benevolence International Foundation prove the name was not simply adopted by the mujahideen movement and that a group called al-Qaeda was established in August 1988.
" Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term ""al-Qaeda""."
"Former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as ""the database"", because it originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians."
" In April 2002, the group assumed the name Qa'idat al-Jihad (قاعدة الجهاد qāʿidat al-jihād), which means ""the base of Jihad""."
" According to Diaa Rashwan, this was ""apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt's al-Jihad, which was led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s."
The radical Islamist movement developed during the Islamic revival and the rise of the Islamist movement after the Iranian Revolution (1978-1979).
Some have argued that the writings of Islamic author and thinker Sayyid Qutb inspired the al-Qaeda organization.
" In the 1950s and 1960s, Qutb preached that because of the lack of sharia law, the Muslim world was no longer Muslim, and had reverted to the pre-Islamic ignorance known as jahiliyyah."
" To restore Islam, Qutb argued that a vanguard of righteous Muslims was needed in order to establish ""true Islamic states"", implement sharia, and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences."
" In Qutb's view, the enemies of Islam included ""world Jewry"", which ""plotted conspiracies"" and opposed Islam."
"In the words of Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, a close college friend of bin Laden: Islam is different from any other religion; it's a way of life."
" We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk."
" Zawahiri's uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb's student, protégé, personal lawyer, and an executor of his estate."
 Azzam was one of the last people to see Qutb alive before his execution.
 Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work Knights under the Prophet's Banner.
" These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce sharia law."
The Afghan jihad against the pro-Soviet government further developed the Salafist Jihadist movement which inspired Al-Qaeda.
"While the leadership's own theological platform is essentially Salafi, the organization's umbrella is sufficiently wide to encompass various schools of thought and political leanings."
" Al-Qaeda counts among its members and supporters people associated with Wahhabism, Shafi'ism, Malikism, and Hanafism."
" There are even some Al-Qaeda members whose beliefs and practices are directly at odds with Salafism, such as Yunis Khalis, one of the leaders of the Afghan mujahedin."
 He was a mystic who visited the tombs of saints and sought their blessings – practices inimical to bin Laden's Wahhabi-Salafi school of thought.
" Al-Qaeda seems implacably opposed to it, as it holds Shi'ism to be heresy."
" In Iraq it has openly declared war on the Badr Brigades, who have fully cooperated with the US, and now considers even Shi'i civilians to be legitimate targets for acts of violence."
"Following its 9/11 attack and in response to its condemnation by Islamic scholars, Al-Qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, ""A Statement from Qaidat al-Jihad Regarding the Mandates of the Heroes and the Legality of the Operations in New York and Washington""."
" According to a couple of critics, Quintan Wiktorowicz and John Kaltner, it provides ""ample theological justification for killing civilians in almost any imaginable situation."
"""Among these justifications are that America is leading the west in waging a War on Islam so that attacks on America are a defense of Islam and any treaties and agreements between Muslim majority states and Western countries that would be violated by attacks are null and void."
" According to the tract, several conditions allow for the killing of civilians including:
"
"retaliation for the American war on Islam which al-Qaeda alleges has targeted ""Muslim women, children and elderly"";
"
"when it is too difficult to distinguish between non-combatants and combatants when attacking an enemy ""stronghold"" (hist) and/or non-combatants remain in enemy territory, killing them is allowed;
"
"those who assist the enemy ""in deed, word, mind"" are eligible for killing, and this includes the general population in democratic countries because civilians can vote in elections that bring enemies of Islam to power;
"
"the necessity of killing in the war to protect Islam and Muslims;
"
"the prophet Muhammad, when asked whether the Muslim fighters could use the catapult against the village of Taif, replied affirmatively, even though the enemy fighters were mixed with a civilian population;
"
"if the women, children and other protected groups serve as human shields for the enemy;
"
"if the enemy has broken a treaty, killing of civilians is permitted."
"The Guardian in 2009 described five distinct phases in the development of al-Qaeda: its beginnings in the late 1980s, a ""wilderness"" period in 1990–1996, its ""heyday"" in 1996–2001, a network period from 2001 to 2005, and a period of fragmentation from 2005 to 2009."
The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced to the Soviet War in Afghanistan (December 1979 – February 1989).
" The United States viewed the conflict in Afghanistan in terms of the Cold War, with Marxists on one side and the native Afghan mujahideen on the other."
" This view led to a CIA program called Operation Cyclone, which channeled funds through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency to the Afghan Mujahideen."
 The US government provided substantial financial support to the Afghan Islamic militants.
" Aid to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an Afghan mujahideen leader and founder of the Hezb-e Islami, amounted to more than $600 million."
" In addition to American aid, Hekmatyar was the recipient of Saudi aid."
" In the early 1990s, after the US had withdrawn support, Hekmatyar ""worked closely"" with bin Laden."
"At the same time, a growing number of Arab mujahideen joined the jihad against the Afghan Marxist regime, which was facilitated by international Muslim organizations, particularly the Maktab al-Khidamat (MAK)."
" In 1984, MAK was established in Peshawar, Pakistan, by bin Laden and Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, a Palestinian Islamic scholar and member of the Muslim Brotherhood."
" MAK organized guest houses in Peshawar, near the Afghan border, and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the Afghan war front."
 MAK was funded by the Saudi government as well as by individual Muslims including Saudi businessmen.
" Bin Laden also became a major financier of the mujahideen, spending his own money and using his connections to influence public opinion about the war."
"From 1986, MAK began to set up a network of recruiting offices in the US, the hub of which was the Al Kifah Refugee Center at the Farouq Mosque on Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue."
" Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center were ""double agent"" Ali Mohamed, whom FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called ""bin Laden's first trainer"", and ""Blind Sheikh"" Omar Abdel-Rahman, a leading recruiter of mujahideen for Afghanistan."
 Azzam and bin Laden began to establish camps in Afghanistan in 1987.
"MAK and foreign mujahideen volunteers, or ""Afghan Arabs"", did not play a major role in the war."
" While over 250,000 Afghan mujahideen fought the Soviets and the communist Afghan government, it is estimated that there were never more than two thousand foreign mujahideen on the field at any one time."
" Nonetheless, foreign mujahideen volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number who participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000."
 Bin Laden played a central role in organizing training camps for the foreign Muslim volunteers.
" Mohammad Najibullah's Communist Afghan government lasted for three more years, before it was overrun by elements of the mujahideen."
"Toward the end of the Soviet military mission in Afghanistan, some foreign mujahideen wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world, such as Palestine and Kashmir."
" A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations."
 One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda.
"Research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed on August 11, 1988, when a meeting in Afghanistan between leaders of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Abdullah Azzam, and bin Laden took place."
 An agreement was reached to link bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.
"Notes indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by August 20, 1988."
" A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (bayat ) to follow one's superiors."
" In his memoir, bin Laden's former bodyguard, Nasser al-Bahri, gives the only publicly available description of the ritual of giving bayat when he swore his allegiance to the al-Qaeda chief."
" According to Wright, the group's real name was not used in public pronouncements because ""its existence was still a closely held secret."
"""After Azzam was assassinated in 1989 and MAK broke up, significant numbers of MAK followers joined bin Laden's new organization."
"In November 1989, Ali Mohamed, a former special forces sergeant stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, left military service and moved to California."
" He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and became ""deeply involved with bin Laden's plans."
""" In 1991, Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden's relocation to Sudan."
"Following the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia."
 The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk.
" The world's most valuable oil fields were within striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent."
"In the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were outnumbered."
 Bin Laden offered the services of his mujahideen to King Fahd to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army.
" The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden's offer, opting instead to allow US and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory."
"The deployment angered bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the ""land of the two mosques"" (Mecca and Medina) profaned sacred soil."
" After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan."
"From around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician Hassan al-Turabi."
" The move followed an Islamist coup d'état in Sudan, led by Colonel Omar al-Bashir, who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values."
" During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established training camps."
"A key turning point for bin Laden occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the Oslo Accords, which set a path for peace between Israel and Palestinians."
" Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan on March 5, 1994 demanding bin Laden's passport."
" His family was persuaded to cut off his stipend, $7 million a year, and his Saudi assets were frozen."
 There is controversy as to what extent bin Laden continued to garner support from members afterwards.
"In 1993, a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the Egyptian prime minister, Atef Sedki."
" Egyptian public opinion turned against Islamist bombings, and the police arrested 280 of al-Jihad's members and executed 6."
" In June 1995, an attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak led to the expulsion of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), and in May 1996, of bin Laden from Sudan."
"According to Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz, the Sudanese government offered the Clinton Administration numerous opportunities to arrest bin Laden."
" Ijaz's claims appeared in numerous op-ed pieces, including one in the Los Angeles Times and one in The Washington Post co-written with former Ambassador to Sudan Timothy M."
" Similar allegations have been made by Vanity Fair contributing editor David Rose, and Richard Miniter, author of Losing bin Laden, in a November 2003 interview with World."
"Several sources dispute Ijaz's claim, including the 9/11 Commission, which concluded in part: Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the US."
 The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so.
 Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin.
" Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment out-standing."
"After the fall of the Afghan communist regime in 1992, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for four years and plagued by constant infighting between various mujahideen groups."
" The Taliban also garnered support from graduates of Islamic schools, which are called madrassa."
" According to Ahmed Rashid, five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of Darul Uloom Haqqania, a madrassa in the small town of Akora Khattak."
" The town is situated near Peshawar in Pakistan, but the school is largely attended by Afghan refugees."
" This institution reflected Salafi beliefs in its teachings, and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs."
 Four of the Taliban's leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar.
" Bin Laden's contacts were laundering donations to these schools, and Islamic banks were used to transfer money to an ""array"" of charities which served as front groups for al-Qaeda."
Many of the mujahideen who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi's Harkat i Inqilabi group at the time of the Russian invasion.
 This group also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.
"The continuing lawlessness enabled the growing and well-disciplined Taliban to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan."
" In 1994, it captured the regional center of Kandahar, and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter, the Taliban captured the capital city Kabul in September 1996."
"In 1996, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan provided a perfect staging ground for al-Qaeda."
" While not officially working together, Al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban's protection and supported the regime in such a strong symbiotic relationship that many Western observers dubbed the Taliban's Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as, ""the world's first terrorist-sponsored state."
""" However, at this time, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan."
"While in Afghanistan, the Taliban government tasked al-Qaeda with the training of Brigade 055, an elite element of the Taliban's army."
" The Brigade mostly consisted of foreign fighters, veterans from the Soviet Invasion, and adherents to the ideology of the mujahideen."
" In November 2001, as Operation Enduring Freedom had toppled the Taliban government, many Brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed, and those who survived were thought to have escaped into Pakistan along with bin Laden."
"By the end of 2008, some sources reported that the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda, however, there is reason to doubt this."
" According to senior US military intelligence officials, there were fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan in 2009."
"Al Qaeda chief, Asim Omar was killed in Afghanistan's Musa Qala district after a joint US–Afghanistan commando airstrike on September 23, Afghan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) confirmed in October 2019."
"In a report released May 27, 2020, the United Nations' Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team stated that the Taliban-Al Qaeda relations remain strong to this day and additionally, Al Qaeda itself has admitted that it operates inside Afghanistan."
"On July 26, 2020, a United Nations report stated that the Al Qaeda group is still active in twelve provinces in Afghanistan and its leader al-Zawahiri is still based in the country."
" and that the UN Monitoring Team estimated that the total number of Al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan were ""between 400 and 600""."
"In 1994, the Salafi groups waging Salafi jihadism in Bosnia entered into decline, and groups such as the Egyptian Islamic Jihad began to drift away from the Salafi cause in Europe."
 Al-Qaeda stepped in and assumed control of around 80% of non-state armed cells in Bosnia in late 1995.
" At the same time, al-Qaeda ideologues instructed the network's recruiters to look for Jihadi international Muslims who believed that extremist-jihad must be fought on a global level."
" Al-Qaeda also sought to open the ""offensive phase"" of the global Salafi jihad."
" Bosnian Islamists in 2006 called for ""solidarity with Islamic causes around the world"", supporting the insurgents in Kashmir and Iraq as well as the groups fighting for a Palestinian state."
"In 1996, al-Qaeda announced its jihad to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered Islamic lands."
" Bin Laden issued a fatwa, which amounted to a public declaration of war against the US and its allies, and began to refocus al-Qaeda's resources on large-scale, propagandist strikes."
"On February 23, 1998, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, along with three other Islamist leaders, co-signed and issued a fatwa calling on Muslims to kill Americans and their allies."
" Under the banner of the World Islamic Front for Combat Against the Jews and Crusaders, they declared:
"
"[T]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies – civilians and military – is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim."
" This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah, 'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together [and] fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah."
Neither bin Laden nor al-Zawahiri possessed the traditional Islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a fatwa.
" However, they rejected the authority of the contemporary ulema (which they saw as the paid servants of jahiliyya rulers), and took it upon themselves."
Al-Qaeda has launched attacks against the Iraqi Shia majority in an attempt to incite sectarian violence.
 Al-Zarqawi purportedly declared an all-out war on Shiites while claiming responsibility for Shiite mosque bombings.
" The same month, a statement claiming to be from Al-Qaeda in Iraq was rejected as a ""fake""."
" In a December 2007 video, al-Zawahiri defended the Islamic State in Iraq, but distanced himself from the attacks against civilians, which he deemed to be perpetrated by ""hypocrites and traitors existing among the ranks""."
US and Iraqi officials accused Al-Qaeda in Iraq of trying to slide Iraq into a full-scale civil war between Iraq's Shiite population and Sunni Arabs.
 This was done through an orchestrated campaign of civilian massacres and a number of provocative attacks against high-profile religious targets.
" With attacks including the 2003 Imam Ali Mosque bombing, the 2004 Day of Ashura and Karbala and Najaf bombings, the 2006 first al-Askari Mosque bombing in Samarra, the deadly single-day series of bombings in which at least 215 people were killed in Baghdad's Shiite district of Sadr City, and the second al-Askari bombing in 2007, Al-Qaeda in Iraq provoked Shiite militias to unleash a wave of retaliatory attacks, resulting in death squad-style killings and further sectarian violence which escalated in 2006."
" In 2008, sectarian bombings blamed on al-Qaeda in Iraq killed at least 42 people at the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala in March, and at least 51 people at a bus stop in Baghdad in June."
"In February 2014, after a prolonged dispute with al-Qaeda in Iraq's successor organisation, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), al-Qaeda publicly announced it was cutting all ties with the group, reportedly for its brutality and ""notorious intractability""."
"In Somalia, al-Qaeda agents had been collaborating closely with its Somali wing, which was created from the al-Shabaab group."
" In February 2012, al-Shabaab officially joined al-Qaeda, declaring loyalty in a video."
 Somalian al-Qaeda recruited children for suicide-bomber training and recruited young people to participate in militant actions against Americans.
"The percentage of attacks in the First World originating from the Afghanistan–Pakistan (AfPak) border declined starting in 2007, as al-Qaeda shifted to Somalia and Yemen."
" While al-Qaeda leaders were hiding in the tribal areas along the AfPak border, middle-tier leaders heightened activity in Somalia and Yemen."
"In January 2009, al-Qaeda's division in Saudi Arabia merged with its Yemeni wing to form al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP)."
" Centered in Yemen, the group takes advantage of the country's poor economy, demography and domestic security."
" In August 2009, the group made an assassination attempt against a member of the Saudi royal family."
" President Obama asked Ali Abdullah Saleh to ensure closer cooperation with the US in the struggle against the growing activity of al-Qaeda in Yemen, and promised to send additional aid."
 The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan drew US attention from Somalia and Yemen.
" In December 2011, US Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said the US operations against al-Qaeda ""are now concentrating on key groups in Yemen, Somalia and North Africa."
""" Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the 2009 bombing attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab."
" The AQAP declared the Al-Qaeda Emirate in Yemen on March 31, 2011, after capturing the most of the Abyan Governorate."
"As the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen escalated in July 2015, fifty civilians had been killed and twenty million needed aid."
" In February 2016, al-Qaeda forces and Saudi Arabian-led coalition forces were both seen fighting Houthi rebels in the same battle."
" In August 2018, Al Jazeera reported that ""A military coalition battling Houthi rebels secured secret deals with al-Qaeda in Yemen and recruited hundreds of the group's fighters."
" Key figures in the deal-making said the United States was aware of the arrangements and held off on drone attacks against the armed group, which was created by Osama bin Laden in 1988."
"In December 1998, the Director of the CIA Counterterrorism Center reported to President Bill Clinton that al-Qaeda was preparing to launch attacks in the United States, and the group was training personnel to hijack aircraft."
" On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda attacked the United States, hijacking four airliners within the country and deliberately crashing two into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City."
" The third plane crashed into the western side of the Pentagon in Arlington County, Virginia."
" The fourth plane was crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania."
" In total, the attackers killed 2,977 victims and injured more than 6,000 others."
US officials noted that Anwar al-Awlaki had considerable reach within the US.
" A former FBI agent identified Awlaki as a known ""senior recruiter for al-Qaeda"", and a spiritual motivator."
" Awlaki's sermons in the US were attended by three of the 9/11 hijackers, and accused Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan."
 US intelligence intercepted emails from Hasan to Awlaki between December 2008 and early 2009.
" On his website, Awlaki has praised Hasan's actions in the Fort Hood shooting."
"An unnamed official claimed there was good reason to believe Awlaki ""has been involved in very serious terrorist activities since leaving the US [in 2002], including plotting attacks against America and our allies."
""" US President Barack Obama approved the targeted killing of al-Awlaki by April 2010, making al-Awlaki the first US citizen ever placed on the CIA target list."
" That required the consent of the US National Security Council, and officials argued that the attack was appropriate because the individual posed an imminent danger to national security."
" In May 2010, Faisal Shahzad, who pleaded guilty to the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt, told interrogators he was ""inspired by"" al-Awlaki, and sources said Shahzad had made contact with al-Awlaki over the Internet."
" Representative Jane Harman called him ""terrorist number one"", and Investor's Business Daily called him ""the world's most dangerous man""."
" In July 2010, the US Treasury Department added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, and the UN added him to its list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda."
" In August 2010, al-Awlaki's father initiated a lawsuit against the US government with the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki."
" In October 2010, US and UK officials linked al-Awlaki to the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot."
" In September 2011, al-Awlaki was killed in a targeted killing drone attack in Yemen."
" On March 16, 2012, it was reported that Osama bin Laden plotted to kill US President Barack Obama."
"On May 1, 2011, US President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden had been killed by ""a small team of Americans"" acting under direct orders, in a covert operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan."
" According to US officials, a team of 20–25 US Navy SEALs under the command of the Joint Special Operations Command stormed bin Laden's compound with two helicopters."
 Bin Laden and those with him were killed during a firefight in which US forces experienced no casualties.
 According to one US official the attack was carried out without the knowledge or consent of the Pakistani authorities.
 In Pakistan some people were reported to be shocked at the unauthorized incursion by US armed forces.
 The site is a few miles from the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul.
" In his broadcast announcement President Obama said that US forces ""took care to avoid civilian casualties""."
"Details soon emerged that three men and a woman were killed along with bin Laden, the woman being killed when she was ""used as a shield by a male combatant""."
" DNA from bin Laden's body, compared with DNA samples on record from his dead sister, confirmed bin Laden's identity."
" The body was recovered by the US military and was in its custody until, according to one US official, his body was buried at sea according to Islamic traditions."
" One US official said that ""finding a country willing to accept the remains of the world's most wanted terrorist would have been difficult."
""" US State Department issued a ""Worldwide caution"" for Americans following bin Laden's death and US diplomatic facilities everywhere were placed on high alert, a senior US official said."
 Crowds gathered outside the White House and in New York City's Times Square to celebrate bin Laden's death.
"In 2003, President Bashar al-Assad revealed in an interview with a Kuwaiti newspaper that he doubted al-Qaeda even existed."
" He was quoted as saying, ""Is there really an entity called al-Qaeda? Was it in Afghanistan? Does it exist now?"" He went on further to remark about bin Laden, commenting ""[he] cannot talk on the phone or use the Internet, but he can direct communications to the four corners of the world? This is illogical."
"""Following the mass protests that took place in 2011, which demanded the resignation of al-Assad, al-Qaeda-affiliated groups and Sunni sympathizers soon began to constitute an effective fighting force against al-Assad."
" Before the Syrian Civil War, al-Qaeda's presence in Syria was negligible, but its growth thereafter was rapid."
 Groups such as the al-Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant have recruited many foreign Mujahideen to train and fight in what has gradually become a highly sectarian war.
" Ideologically, the Syrian Civil War has served the interests of al-Qaeda as it pits a mainly Sunni opposition against a secular government."
" Al-Qaeda and other fundamentalist Sunni militant groups have invested heavily in the civil conflict, at times actively backing and supporting the mainstream Syrian Opposition."
"On February 2, 2014, al-Qaeda distanced itself from ISIS and its actions in Syria; however, during 2014–15, ISIS and the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front were still able to occasionally cooperate in their fight against the Syrian government."
" Al-Nusra (backed by Saudi Arabia and Turkey as part of the Army of Conquest during 2015–2017) launched many attacks and bombings, mostly against targets affiliated with or supportive of the Syrian government."
" From October 2015, Russian air strikes targeted positions held by al-Nusra Front, as well as other Islamist and non-Islamist rebels, while the US also targeted al-Nusra with airstrikes."
" In early 2016, a leading ISIL ideologue described al-Qaeda as the ""Jews of jihad""."
"In September 2014 al-Zawahiri announced al-Qaeda was establishing a front in India to ""wage jihad against its enemies, to liberate its land, to restore its sovereignty, and to revive its Caliphate."
""" Al-Zawahiri nominated India as a beachhead for regional jihad taking in neighboring countries such as Myanmar and Bangladesh."
" The motivation for the video was questioned, as it appeared the militant group was struggling to remain relevant in light of the emerging prominence of ISIS."
" The new wing was to be known as ""Qaedat al-Jihad fi'shibhi al-qarrat al-Hindiya"" or al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS)."
" Leaders of several Indian Muslim organizations rejected al-Zawahiri's pronouncement, saying they could see no good coming from it, and viewed it as a threat to Muslim youth in the country."
"In 2014 Zee News reported that Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and National Security Council official for South Asia, had accused the Pakistani military intelligence and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) of organising and assisting Al-Qaeda to organise in India, that Pakistan ought to be warned that it will be placed on the list of State Sponsors of Terrorism, and that ""Zawahiri made the tape in his hideout in Pakistan, no doubt, and many Indians suspect the ISI is helping to protect him."
"Al-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major attacks, four of them in its jihad against America."
" In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities."
"On December 29, 1992, al-Qaeda launched its first attack, the 1992 Yemen hotel bombings."
 The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel.
"The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, Operation Restore Hope."
" Internally, al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the US, the attack was barely noticed."
 No American soldiers were killed because no soldiers were staying in the hotel which was bombed.
" However, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker were killed in the bombing."
" Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by al-Qaeda's members, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, to justify the killings according to Islamic law."
" Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by Ibn Taymiyyah, a 13th-century scholar much admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions."
"In 1996, bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate United States President Bill Clinton while the president was in Manila for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation."
" However, intelligence agents intercepted a message before the motorcade was to leave, and alerted the US Secret Service."
"On August 7, 1998, al-Qaeda bombed the US embassies in East Africa, killing 224 people, including 12 Americans."
" In retaliation, a barrage of cruise missiles launched by the US military devastated an al-Qaeda base in Khost, Afghanistan."
" In late 1999 and 2000, Al-Qaeda planned attacks to coincide with the millennium, masterminded by Abu Zubaydah and involving Abu Qatada, which would include the bombing of Christian holy sites in Jordan, the bombing of Los Angeles International Airport by Ahmed Ressam, and the bombing of the USS The Sullivans (DDG-68)."
"On October 12, 2000, al-Qaeda militants in Yemen bombed the missile destroyer USS Cole in a suicide attack, killing 17 US servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore."
" Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack, al-Qaeda's command core began to prepare for an attack on the US itself."
"The September 11 attacks on America by al-Qaeda killed 2,977 people – 2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, and 55 military personnel."
" Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target either the United States Capitol or the White House, crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania."
" It was also the deadliest foreign attack on American soil since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941."
"The attacks were conducted by al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the 1998 fatwa issued against the US and its allies by persons under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others."
" Evidence points to suicide squads led by al-Qaeda military commander Mohamed Atta as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, and Hambali as the key planners and part of the political and military command."
"Messages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001 praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement."
" Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the US was actively oppressing Muslims."
"Bin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in ""Palestine, Chechnya, Kashmir and Iraq"" and Muslims should retain the ""right to attack in reprisal""."
" He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at people, but ""America's icons of military and economic power"", despite the fact he planned to attack in the morning when most of the people in the intended targets were present and thus generating the maximum number of human casualties."
Evidence has since come to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the US East Coast.
" The targets were later altered by al-Qaeda, as it was feared that such an attack ""might get out of hand""."
"Al-Qaeda is deemed a designated terrorist group by the following countries and international organizations:
"
"In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US government responded, and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the Taliban, which it believed was harboring al-Qaeda."
 The US offered Taliban leader Mullah Omar a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates.
 The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite Special Activities Division (SAD).
The Taliban offered to turn over bin Laden to a neutral country for trial if the US would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks.
" Turn him over"", and British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned the Taliban regime: ""Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power."
"""Soon thereafter the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the Afghan Northern Alliance removed the Taliban government as part of the war in Afghanistan."
" As a result of the US special forces and air support for the Northern Alliance ground forces, a number of Taliban and al-Qaeda training camps were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted."
" After being driven from their key positions in the Tora Bora area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged Gardez region of the nation."
"By early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared to be a success."
" Nevertheless, a significant Taliban insurgency remained in Afghanistan."
Debate continued regarding the nature of al-Qaeda's role in the 9/11 attacks.
 The US State Department released a videotape showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power.
" Although its authenticity has been questioned by a couple of people, the tape definitively implicates bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks."
" The tape was aired on many television channels, with an accompanying English translation provided by the US Defense Department."
"In September 2004, the 9/11 Commission officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives."
" In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a videotape released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon: ""As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children."
"""By the end of 2004, the US government proclaimed that two-thirds of the most senior al-Qaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the CIA: Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in 2002; Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in 2003; and Saif al Islam el Masry in 2004."
 The West was criticized for not being able to handle Al-Qaida despite a decade of the war.
"Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, while supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia."
" From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan."
Islamist rebels in the Sahara calling themselves al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have stepped up their violence in recent years.
" French officials say the rebels have no real links to the al-Qaeda leadership, but this has been disputed."
" It seems likely that bin Laden approved the group's name in late 2006, and the rebels ""took on the al Qaeda franchise label"", almost a year before the violence began to escalate."
"In Mali, the Ansar Dine faction was also reported as an ally of al-Qaeda in 2013."
 The Ansar al Dine faction aligned themselves with the AQIM.
"In 2011, Al-Qaeda's North African wing condemned Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and declared support for the Anti-Gaddafi rebels."
"Following the Libyan Civil War, the removal of Gaddafi and the ensuing period of post-civil war violence in Libya, various Islamist militant groups affiliated with al-Qaeda were able to expand their operations in the region."
" The 2012 Benghazi attack, which resulted in the death of US Ambassador J."
" Christopher Stevens and three other Americans, is suspected of having been carried out by various Jihadist networks, such as Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Ansar al-Sharia and several other Al-Qaeda affiliated groups."
" The capture of Nazih Abdul-Hamed al-Ruqai, a senior al-Qaeda operative wanted by the United States for his involvement in the 1998 United States embassy bombings, on October 5, 2013, by US Navy Seals, FBI and CIA agents illustrates the importance the US and other Western allies have placed on North Africa."
"Prior to the September 11 attacks, al-Qaeda was present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its members were mostly veterans of the El Mudžahid detachment of the Bosnian Muslim Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
 Three al-Qaeda operatives carried out the Mostar car bombing in 1997.
 The operatives were closely linked to and financed by the Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia and Herzegovina founded by then-prince King Salman of Saudi Arabia.
"Before the 9/11 attacks and the US invasion of Afghanistan, westerners who had been recruits at al-Qaeda training camps were sought after by al-Qaeda's military wing."
" Language skills and knowledge of Western culture were generally found among recruits from Europe, such was the case with Mohamed Atta, an Egyptian national studying in Germany at the time of his training, and other members of the Hamburg Cell."
 Osama bin Laden and Mohammed Atef would later designate Atta as the ringleader of the 9/11 hijackers.
" Following the attacks, Western intelligence agencies determined that al-Qaeda cells operating in Europe had aided the hijackers with financing and communications with the central leadership based in Afghanistan."
"In 2003, Islamists carried out a series of bombings in Istanbul killing fifty-seven people and injuring seven hundred."
 Seventy-four people were charged by the Turkish authorities.
" Some had previously met bin Laden, and though they specifically declined to pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda they asked for its blessing and help."
"In 2009, three Londoners, Tanvir Hussain, Assad Sarwar and Ahmed Abdullah Ali, were convicted of conspiring to detonate bombs disguised as soft drinks on seven airplanes bound for Canada and the US The MI5 investigation regarding the plot involved more than a year of surveillance work conducted by over two hundred officers."
 British and US officials said the plot – unlike many similar homegrown European Islamic militant plots – was directly linked to al-Qaeda and guided by senior al-Qaeda members in Pakistan.
"In 2012, Russian Intelligence indicated that al-Qaeda had given a call for ""forest jihad"" and has been starting massive forest fires as part of a strategy of ""thousand cuts""."
"Following Yemeni unification in 1990, Wahhabi networks began moving missionaries into the country."
" Although it is unlikely bin Laden or Saudi al-Qaeda were directly involved, the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the USS Cole bombing."
"In Iraq, al-Qaeda forces loosely associated with the leadership were embedded in the Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad group commanded by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi."
" Specializing in suicide operations, they have been a ""key driver"" of the Sunni insurgency."
" Although they played a small part in the overall insurgency, between 30% and 42% of all suicide bombings which took place in the early years were claimed by Zarqawi's group."
 Reports have indicated that oversights such as the failure to control access to the Qa'qaa munitions factory in Yusufiyah have allowed large quantities of munitions to fall into the hands of al-Qaida.
" In November 2010, the militant group Islamic State of Iraq, which is linked to al-Qaeda in Iraq, threatened to ""exterminate all Iraqi Christians""."
Al-Qaeda did not begin training Palestinians until the late 1990s.
" Large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad have rejected an alliance with al-Qaeda, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their cells."
" The Israeli security and intelligence services believe al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for an opportunity to attack."
"As of 2015, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey are openly supporting the Army of Conquest, an umbrella rebel group fighting in the Syrian Civil War against the Syrian government that reportedly includes an al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front and another Salafi coalition known as Ahrar al-Sham."
Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri consider India to be a part of an alleged Crusader-Zionist-Hindu conspiracy against the Islamic world.
" According to a 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service, bin Laden was involved in training militants for Jihad in Kashmir while living in Sudan in the early 1990s."
" By 2001, Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen had become a part of the al-Qaeda coalition."
" According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), al-Qaeda was thought to have established bases in Pakistan administered Kashmir (in Azad Kashmir, and to some extent in Gilgit–Baltistan) during the 1999 Kargil War and continued to operate there with tacit approval of Pakistan's Intelligence services."
Many of the militants active in Kashmir were trained in the same madrasahs as Taliban and al-Qaeda.
 Fazlur Rehman Khalil of Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen was a signatory of al-Qaeda's 1998 declaration of Jihad against America and its allies.
" In a 'Letter to American People' (2002), bin Laden wrote that one of the reasons he was fighting America was because of its support to India on the Kashmir issue."
" In November 2001, Kathmandu airport went on high alert after threats that bin Laden planned to hijack a plane and crash it into a target in New Delhi."
" In 2002, US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, on a trip to Delhi, suggested that al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir though he did not have any evidence."
 Rumsfeld proposed hi-tech ground sensors along the Line of Control to prevent militants from infiltrating into Indian-administered Kashmir.
An investigation in 2002 found evidence that al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence.
" In 2002, a special team of Special Air Service and Delta Force was sent into Indian-Administered Kashmir to hunt for bin Laden after receiving reports that he was being sheltered by Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, which had been responsible for kidnapping western tourists in Kashmir in 1995."
 Britain's highest-ranking al-Qaeda operative Rangzieb Ahmed had previously fought in Kashmir with the group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and spent time in Indian prison after being captured in Kashmir.
US officials believe al-Qaeda was helping organize attacks in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan.
" Their strategy was to force Pakistan to move its troops to the border with India, thereby relieving pressure on al-Qaeda elements hiding in northwestern Pakistan."
 In 2006 al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir.
 Panag argued that the army had ruled out the presence of al-Qaeda in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir.
 Panag also said al-Qaeda had strong ties with Kashmiri militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed based in Pakistan.
 It has been noted that Waziristan has become a battlefield for Kashmiri militants fighting NATO in support of al-Qaeda and Taliban.
" Dhiren Barot, who wrote the Army of Madinah in Kashmir and was an al-Qaeda operative convicted for involvement in the 2004 financial buildings plot, had received training in weapons and explosives at a militant training camp in Kashmir."
"Maulana Masood Azhar, the founder of Kashmiri group Jaish-e-Mohammed, is believed to have met bin Laden several times and received funding from him."
" In 2002, Jaish-e-Mohammed organized the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl in an operation run in conjunction with al-Qaeda and funded by bin Laden."
" According to American counter-terrorism expert Bruce Riedel, al-Qaeda and Taliban were closely involved in the 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 to Kandahar which led to the release of Maulana Masood Azhar and Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh from an Indian prison."
" This hijacking, Riedel said, was rightly described by then Indian Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh as a 'dress rehearsal' for September 11 attacks."
 Bin Laden personally welcomed Azhar and threw a lavish party in his honor after his release.
" Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had been in prison for his role in the 1994 kidnappings of Western tourists in India, went on to murder Daniel Pearl and was sentenced to death in Pakistan."
" Al-Qaeda operative Rashid Rauf, who was one of the accused in 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, was related to Maulana Masood Azhar by marriage."
"Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Kashmiri militant group which is thought to be behind 2008 Mumbai attacks, is also known to have strong ties to senior al-Qaeda leaders living in Pakistan."
" In late 2002, top al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah was arrested while being sheltered by Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safe house in Faisalabad."
 The FBI believes al-Qaeda and Lashkar have been 'intertwined' for a long time while the CIA has said that al-Qaeda funds Lashkar-e-Taiba.
" Jean-Louis Bruguière told Reuters in 2009 that ""Lashkar-e-Taiba is no longer a Pakistani movement with only a Kashmir political or military agenda."
"""In a video released in 2008, American-born senior al-Qaeda operative Adam Yahiye Gadahn said that ""victory in Kashmir has been delayed for years; it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which, Allah willing, will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land."
"""In September 2009, a US drone strike reportedly killed Ilyas Kashmiri who was the chief of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, a Kashmiri militant group associated with al-Qaeda."
 Kashmiri was described by Bruce Riedel as a 'prominent' al-Qaeda member while others have described him as head of military operations for al-Qaeda.
" Kashmiri was also charged by the US in a plot against Jyllands-Posten, the Danish newspaper which was at the center of Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy."
 US officials also believe that Kashmiri was involved in the Camp Chapman attack against the CIA.
" In January 2010, Indian authorities notified Britain of an al-Qaeda plot to hijack an Indian airlines or Air India plane and crash it into a British city."
" This information was uncovered from interrogation of Amjad Khwaja, an operative of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, who had been arrested in India."
"In January 2010, US Defense secretary Robert Gates, while on a visit to Pakistan, said that al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan."
Al-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance.
" The group's use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, with online activities that include financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, and information dissemination, gathering and sharing."
Abu Ayyub al-Masri's al-Qaeda movement in Iraq regularly releases short videos glorifying the activity of jihadist suicide bombers.
" In addition, both before and after the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq), the umbrella organization to which al-Qaeda in Iraq belongs, the Mujahideen Shura Council, has a regular presence on the Web."
"The range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips, stills of victims about to be murdered, testimonials of suicide bombers, and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores."
 A website associated with al-Qaeda posted a video of captured American entrepreneur Nick Berg being decapitated in Iraq.
" Other decapitation videos and pictures, including those of Paul Johnson, Kim Sun-il, and Daniel Pearl, were first posted on jihadist websites."
"In December 2004 an audio message claiming to be from bin Laden was posted directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to al Jazeera as he had done in the past."
" Al-Qaeda turned to the Internet for release of its videos in order to be certain they would be available unedited, rather than risk the possibility of al Jazeera editing out anything critical of the Saudi royal family."
" Alneda was initially taken down by American Jon Messner, but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically shifting content."
"The US government charged a British information technology specialist, Babar Ahmad, with terrorist offences related to his operating a network of English-language al-Qaeda websites, such as Azzam."
 He was convicted and sentenced to 12-and-a-half years in prison.
"In 2007, al-Qaeda released Mujahedeen Secrets, encryption software used for online and cellular communications."
" A later version, Mujahideen Secrets 2, was released in 2008."
"Al-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including ""several Boeing 727 aircraft"", turboprops and executive jets, according to a 2010 Reuters story."
" Based on a US Department of Homeland Security report, the story said al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa."
" The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere."
 Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly kidnapping Europeans for ransom.
" The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities."
The following is a list of military conflicts in which Al-Qaeda and its direct affiliates have taken part militarily.
 Experts debate the notion al-Qaeda attacks were an indirect result from the American CIA's Operation Cyclone program to help the Afghan mujahideen.
" Robin Cook, British Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001, has written that al-Qaeda and bin Laden were ""a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies"", and that ""Al-Qaida, literally 'the database', was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians."
"""Munir Akram, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations from 2002 to 2008, wrote in a letter published in The New York Times on January 19, 2008:
"
"The strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C."
" After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad."
" Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns."
"A variety of sources, including CNN journalist Peter Bergen, Pakistani ISI Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, and CIA operatives involved in the Afghan program, such as Vincent Cannistraro, deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or bin Laden, let alone armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them."
"Bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight."
 Bergen further argues that foreign mujahideen had no need for American funds since they received several million dollars per year from internal sources.
" Lastly, he argues that Americans could not have trained the mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan, and the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans."
"According to Bergen, who conducted the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997: the idea that ""the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden ."
" Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently ."
 The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.
Jason Burke also wrote:Some of the $500 million the CIA poured into Afghanistan reached [Al-Zawahiri's] group.
" Bin Laden was only loosely connected with the [Hezb-i-Islami faction of the mujahideen led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar], serving under another Hezb-i-Islami commander known as Engineer Machmud."
" However, bin Laden's Office of Services, set up to recruit overseas for the war, received some US cash."
A CNN report has revealed that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have been handing out sophisticated American-made weapons to al-Qaeda-linked fighters in Yemen.
"In October 2014, US Vice President Joe Biden said Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates had ""poured hundreds of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of tons of weapons into anyone who would fight against Al-Assad, except that the people who were being supplied were al-Nusra, and al Qaeda, and the extremist elements of jihadis coming from other parts of the world."
"Anders Behring Breivik, the perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, was inspired by Al-Qaeda, calling it ""the most successful revolutionary movement in the world."
""" While admitting different aims, he sought to ""create a European version of Al-Qaida."
"""The appropriate response to offshoots is a subject of debate."
" A journalist reported in 2012 that a senior US military planner had asked: ""Should we resort to drones and Special Operations raids every time some group raises the black banner of al Qaeda? How long can we continue to chase offshoots of offshoots around the world?""
"
Islamic extremism dates back to the Kharijites of the 7th century.
" From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims."
" The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to Takfir, whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death."
"According to a number of sources, a ""wave of revulsion"" has been expressed against al-Qaeda and its affiliates by ""religious scholars, former fighters and militants"" who are alarmed by al-Qaeda's takfir and its killing of Muslims in Muslim countries, especially in Iraq."
"Noman Benotman, a former militant member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), went public with an open letter of criticism to Ayman al-Zawahiri in November 2007, after persuading the imprisoned senior leaders of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the Libyan regime."
" While Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with al-Qaeda in November 2007, the Libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months after ""they were said to have renounced violence."
"""In 2007, on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks, the Saudi sheikh Salman al-Ouda delivered a personal rebuke to bin Laden."
" Al-Ouda, a religious scholar and one of the fathers of the Sahwa, the fundamentalist awakening movement that swept through Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, is a widely respected critic of jihadism."
" Al-Ouda addressed al-Qaeda's leader on television asking him:
"
"My brother Osama, how much blood has been spilt? How many innocent people, children, elderly, and women have been killed ."
" in the name of al-Qaeda? Will you be happy to meet God Almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions [of victims] on your back?
"
"According to Pew polls, support for al-Qaeda had dropped in the Muslim world in the years before 2008."
" Support of suicide bombings in Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh, dropped by half or more in the last five years."
" In Saudi Arabia, only ten percent had a favorable view of al-Qaeda, according to a December 2017 poll by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based think tank."
"In 2007, the imprisoned Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif, an influential Afghan Arab, ""ideological godfather of al-Qaeda"", and former supporter of takfir, withdrew his support from al-Qaeda with a book Wathiqat Tarshid Al-'Aml Al-Jihadi fi Misr w'Al-'Alam (English: Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World)."
"Although once associated with al-Qaeda, in September 2009 LIFG completed a new ""code"" for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled ""Corrective Studies""."
" Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against al-Qaeda, the LIFG's reversal may be an important step toward staunching al-Qaeda's recruitment."
"Bilal Abdul Kareem, an American journalist based in Syria created a documentary about al-Shabab, al-Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia."
 The documentary included interviews with former members of the group who stated their reasons for leaving al-Shabab.
" The members made accusations of segregation, lack of religious awareness and internal corruption and favoritism."
" In response to Kareem, the Global Islamic Media Front condemned Kareem, called him a liar, and denied the accusations from the former fighters."
"In mid-2014 after the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant declared that they had restored the Caliphate, an audio statement was released by the then-spokesman of the group Abu Muhammad al-Adnani claiming that ""the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations, becomes null by the expansion of the Caliphate's authority."
""" The speech included a religious refutation of Al-Qaeda for being too lenient regarding Shiites and their refusal to recognize the authority Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, al-Adnani specifically noting: ""It is not suitable for a state to give allegiance to an organization."
""" He also recalled a past instance in which Osama bin Laden called on al-Qaeda members and supporters to give allegiance to Abu Omar al-Baghdadi when the group was still solely operating in Iraq, as the Islamic State of Iraq, and condemned Ayman al-Zawahiri for not making this same claim for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi."
 Zawahiri was encouraging factionalism and division between former allies of ISIL such as the al-Nusra Front.
