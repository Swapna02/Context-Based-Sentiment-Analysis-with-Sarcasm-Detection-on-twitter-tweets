"Politics (from Greek: Πολιτικά, politiká, 'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status."
 The branch of social science that studies politics is referred to as political science.
"It may be used positively in the context of a ""political solution"" which is compromising and non-violent, or descriptively as ""the art or science of government"", but also often carries a negative connotation."
" For example, abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared that ""we do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us."
""" The concept has been defined in various ways, and different approaches have fundamentally differing views on whether it should be used extensively or limitedly, empirically or normatively, and on whether conflict or co-operation is more essential to it."
"A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries."
" Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level."
" In modern nation states, people often form political parties to represent their ideas."
 Members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.
 An election is usually a competition between different parties.
A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a society.
" The history of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's Republic, Aristotle's Politics, Chanakya's Arthashastra and Chanakya Niti (3rd century BCE), as well as the works of Confucius."
"The English politics has its roots in the name of Aristotle's classic work, Politiká, which introduced the Greek term politiká (Πολιτικά, 'affairs of the cities')."
" In the mid-15th century, Aristotle's composition would be rendered in Early Modern English as Polettiques [sic], which would become Politics in Modern English."
"The singular politic first attested in English in 1430, coming from Middle French politique—itself taking from politicus, a Latinization of the Greek πολιτικός (politikos) from πολίτης (polites, 'citizen') and πόλις (polis, 'city')."
"In the view of Harold Lasswell, politics is ""who gets what, when, how."
"""For David Easton, it is about ""the authoritative allocation of values for a society."
"""To Vladimir Lenin, ""politics is the most concentrated expression of economics."
"""Bernard Crick argued that ""politics is a distinctive form of rule whereby people act together through institutionalized procedures to resolve differences, to conciliate diverse interests and values and to make public policies in the pursuit of common purposes."
"""According to Adrian Leftwich:Politics comprises all the activities of co-operation, negotiation and conflict within and between societies, whereby people go about organizing the use, production or distribution of human, natural and other resources in the course of the production and reproduction of their biological and social life."
There are several ways in which approaching politics has been conceptualized.
Adrian Leftwich has differentiated views of politics based on how extensive or limited their perception of what accounts as 'political' is.
" The extensive view sees politics as present across the sphere of human social relations, while the limited view restricts it to certain contexts."
" For example, in a more restrictive way, politics may be viewed as primarily about governance, while a feminist perspective could argue that sites which have been viewed traditionally as non-political, should indeed be viewed as political as well."
" This latter position is encapsulated in the slogan the personal is political, which disputes the distinction between private and public issues."
" Instead, politics may be defined by the use of power, as has been argued by Robert A."
"Some perspectives on politics view it empirically as an exercise of power, while others see it as a social function with a normative basis."
 This distinction has been called the difference between political moralism and political realism.
" For moralists, politics is closely linked to ethics, and is at its extreme in utopian thinking."
" For example, according to Hannah Arendt, the view of Aristotle was that ""to be political…meant that everything was decided through words and persuasion and not through violence;"" while according to Bernard Crick ""[p]olitics is the way in which free societies are governed."
 Politics is politics and other forms of rule are something else.
""" In contrast, for realists, represented by those such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, and Harold Lasswell, politics is based on the use of power, irrespective of the ends being pursued."
Agonism argues that politics essentially comes down to conflict between conflicting interests.
" Political scientist Elmer Schattschneider argued that ""at the root of all politics is the universal language of conflict,"" while for Carl Schmitt the essence of politics is the distinction of 'friend' from foe'."
 This is in direct contrast to the more co-operative views of politics by Aristotle and Crick.
" However, a more mixed view between these extremes is provided by Irish political scientist Michael Laver, who noted that:Politics is about the characteristic blend of conflict and co-operation that can be found so often in human interactions."
The history of politics spans human history and is not limited to modern institutions of government.
"Frans de Waal argued that already chimpanzees engage in politics through ""social manipulation to secure and maintain influential positions."
""" Early human forms of social organization—bands and tribes—lacked centralized political structures."
"In ancient history, civilizations did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as frontiers."
" Early dynastic Sumer, and early dynastic Egypt were the first civilizations to define their borders."
" Moreover, up to the 12th century, many people lived in non-state societies."
 These range from relatively egalitarian bands and tribes to complex and highly stratified chiefdoms.
There are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not others.
 Other scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.
Voluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest.
" The theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formation."
" One of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the hydraulic hypothesis, which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects."
Conflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states.
" In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others."
 Some theories in turn argue that warfare was critical for state formation.
"The first states of sorts were those of early dynastic Sumer and early dynastic Egypt, which arose from the Uruk period and Predynastic Egypt respectively around approximately 3000 BCE."
" Early dynastic Egypt was based around the Nile River in the north-east of Africa, the kingdom's boundaries being based around the Nile and stretching to areas where oases existed."
 Early dynastic Sumer was located in southern Mesopotamia with its borders extending from the Persian Gulf to parts of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.
"Although state-forms existed before the rise of the Ancient Greek empire, the Greeks were the first people known to have explicitly formulated a political philosophy of the state, and to have rationally analyzed political institutions."
" Prior to this, states were described and justified in terms of religious myths."
Several important political innovations of classical antiquity came from the Greek city-states (polis) and the Roman Republic.
 The Greek city-states before the 4th century granted citizenship rights to their free population; in Athens these rights were combined with a directly democratic form of government that was to have a long afterlife in political thought and history.
"The Peace of Westphalia (1648) is considered by political scientists to be the beginning of the modern international system, in which external powers should avoid interfering in another country's domestic affairs."
 The principle of non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs was laid out in the mid-18th century by Swiss jurist Emer de Vattel.
 States became the primary institutional agents in an interstate system of relations.
 The Peace of Westphalia is said to have ended attempts to impose supranational authority on European states.
" The ""Westphalian"" doctrine of states as independent agents was bolstered by the rise in 19th century thought of nationalism, under which legitimate states were assumed to correspond to nations—groups of people united by language and culture."
"In Europe, during the 18th century, the classic non-national states were the multinational empires: the Austrian Empire, Kingdom of France, Kingdom of Hungary, the Russian Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire."
" Such empires also existed in Asia, Africa, and the Americas; in the Muslim world, immediately after the death of Muhammad in 632, Caliphates were established, which developed into multi-ethnic trans-national empires."
" The multinational empire was an absolute monarchy ruled by a king, emperor or sultan."
" The population belonged to many ethnic groups, and they spoke many languages."
" The empire was dominated by one ethnic group, and their language was usually the language of public administration."
" The ruling dynasty was usually, but not always, from that group."
" Some of the smaller European states were not so ethnically diverse, but were also dynastic states, ruled by a royal house."
" A few of the smaller states survived, such as the independent principalities of Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, and the republic of San Marino."
"Most theories see the nation state as a 19th-century European phenomenon, facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education, mass literacy, and mass media."
" However, historians also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in Portugal and the Dutch Republic."
" Scholars such as Steven Weber, David Woodward, Michel Foucault, and Jeremy Black have advanced the hypothesis that the nation state did not arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source, nor was it an accident of history or political invention."
" Rather, the nation state is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in political economy, capitalism, mercantilism, political geography, and geography combined together with cartography and advances in map-making technologies."
"Some nation states, such as Germany and Italy, came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by nationalists, during the 19th century."
" In both cases, the territory was previously divided among other states, some of them very small."
" Liberal ideas of free trade played a role in German unification, which was preceded by a customs union, the Zollverein."
" National self-determination was a key aspect of United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, leading to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, while the Russian Empire became the Soviet Union after the Russian Civil War."
 Decolonization lead to the creation of new nation states in place of multinational empires in the Third World.
Political globalization began in the 20th century through intergovernmental organizations and supranational unions.
" The League of Nations was founded after World War I, and after World War II it was replaced by the United Nations."
 Various international treaties have been signed through it.
" Regional integration has been pursued by the African Union, ASEAN, the European Union, and Mercosur."
" International political institutions on the international level include the International Criminal Court, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization."
"The study of politics is called political science, or politology."
" It comprises numerous subfields, including comparative politics, political economy, international relations, political philosophy, public administration, public policy, gender and politics, and political methodology."
" Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of economics, law, sociology, history, philosophy, geography, psychology/psychiatry, anthropology, and neurosciences."
"Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of constitutions, political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective."
 International relations deals with the interaction between nation-states as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations.
 Political philosophy is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.
"Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in psychology, social research, and cognitive neuroscience."
" Approaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational choice theory, behavioralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism, institutionalism, and pluralism."
" Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, survey research, statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research, and model building."
The political system defines the process for making official government decisions.
" It is usually compared to the legal system, economic system, cultural system, and other social systems."
" According to David Easton, ""A political system can be designated as the interactions through which values are authoritatively allocated for a society."
""" Each political system is embedded in a society with its own political culture, and they in turn shape their societies through public policy."
 The interactions between different political systems are the basis for global politics.
" In terms of the structure of power, there are monarchies (including constitutional monarchies) and republics (usually presidential, semi-presidential, or parliamentary)."
"The separation of powers describes the degree of horizontal integration between the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and other independent institutions."
"The source of power determines the difference between democracies, oligarchies, and autocracies."
"In a democracy, political legitimacy is based on popular sovereignty."
" Forms of democracy include representative democracy, direct democracy, and demarchy."
" These are separated by the way decisions are made, whether by elected representatives, referendums, or by citizen juries."
 Democracies can be either republics or constitutional monarchies.
" These may be in the form of anocracy, aristocracy, ergatocracy, geniocracy, gerontocracy, kakistocracy, kleptocracy, meritocracy, noocracy, particracy, plutocracy, stratocracy, technocracy, theocracy, or timocracy."
Autocracies are either dictatorships (including military dictatorships) or absolute monarchies.
"In terms of level of vertical integration, political systems can be divided into (from least to most integrated) confederations, federations, and unitary states."
"A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a central federal government (federalism)."
" In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body."
" Federations were formed first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, Australia."
" Compared to a federation, a confederation has less centralized power."
"All the above forms of government are variations of the same basic polity, the sovereign state."
" The state has been defined by Max Weber as a political entity that has monopoly on violence within its territory, while the Montevideo Convention holds that states need to have a defined territory; a permanent population; a government; and a capacity to enter into international relations."
A stateless society is a society that is not governed by a state.
" In stateless societies, there is little concentration of authority; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in power and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small."
 Stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.
"While stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a sovereign state."
 In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield little or no actual power.
 Over the course of history most stateless peoples have been integrated into the state-based societies around them.
"Some political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved."
 A central tenet of anarchism is the advocacy of society without states.
" The type of society sought for varies significantly between anarchist schools of thought, ranging from extreme individualism to complete collectivism."
" In Marxism, Marx's theory of the state considers that in a post-capitalist society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and wither away."
" A related concept is that of stateless communism, a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx's anticipated post-capitalist society."
Constitutions are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government.
" Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution."
 The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative and judiciary branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate.
 England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the Civil War but after the Restoration abandoned them to be taken up later by the American Colonies after their emancipation and then France after the Revolution and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.
"Constitutions often set out separation of powers, dividing the government into the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary (together referred to as the trias politica), in order to achieve checks and balances within the state."
" Additional independent branches may also be created, including civil service commissions, election commissions, and supreme audit institutions."
 Every political system is embedded in a particular political culture.
" Lucian Pye's definition is that ""Political culture is the set of attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments, which give order and meaning to a political process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the political system""."
"Trust is a major factor in political culture, as its level determines the capacity of the state to function."
" Postmaterialism is the degree to which a political culture is concerned with issues which are not of immediate physical or material concern, such as human rights and environmentalism."
"Political corruption is the use of powers for illegitimate private gain, conducted by government officials or their network contacts."
" Forms of political corruption include bribery, cronyism, nepotism, and political patronage."
" Forms of political patronage, in turn, includes clientelism, earmarking, pork barreling, slush funds, and spoils systems; as well as political machines, which is a political system that operates for corrupt ends."
"When corruption is embedded in political culture, this may be referred to as patrimonialism or neopatrimonialism."
 A form of government that is built on corruption is called a kleptocracy ('rule of thieves').
Political conflict entails the use of political violence to achieve political ends.
" As noted by Carl von Clausewitz, ""War is a mere continuation of politics by other means."
""" Beyond just inter-state warfare, this may include civil war; wars of national liberation; or asymmetric warfare, such as guerrilla war or terrorism."
" When a political system is overthrown, the event is called a revolution: it is a political revolution if it does not go further; or a social revolution if the social system is also radically altered."
Macropolitics can either describe political issues that affect an entire political system (e.
" the nation state), or refer to interactions between political systems (e."
"Global politics (or world politics) covers all aspects of politics that affect multiple political systems, in practice meaning any political phenomenon crossing national borders."
" This can include cities, nation-states, multinational corporations, non-governmental organizations, and/or international organizations."
" An important element is international relations: the relations between nation-states may be peaceful when they are conducted through diplomacy, or they may be violent, which is described as war."
" States that are able to exert strong international influence are referred to as superpowers, whereas less-powerful ones may be called regional or middle powers."
" The international system of power is called the world order, which is affected by the balance of power that defines the degree of polarity in the system."
" Emerging powers are potentially destabilizing to it, especially if they display revanchism or irredentism."
"Politics inside the limits of political systems, which in contemporary context correspond to national borders, are referred to as domestic politics."
" This includes most forms of public policy, such as social policy, economic policy, or law enforcement, which are executed by the state bureaucracy."
"Mesopolitics describes the politics of intermediary structures within a political system, such as national political parties or movements."
"A political party is a political organization that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within government, usually by participating in political campaigns, educational outreach, or protest actions."
" Parties often espouse an expressed ideology or vision, bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests."
"Political parties within a particular political system together form the party system, which can be either multiparty, two-party, dominant-party, or one-party, depending on the level of pluralism."
" This is affected by characteristics of the political system, including its electoral system."
" According to Duverger's law, first-past-the-post systems are likely to lead to two-party systems, while proportional representation systems are more likely to create a multiparty system."
Micropolitics describes the actions of individual actors within the political system.
"Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes."
 Democracy makes all forces struggle repeatedly to realize their interests and devolves power from groups of people to sets of rules.
"Among modern political theorists, there are three contending conceptions of democracy: aggregative, deliberative, and radical."
"The theory of aggregative democracy claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit the preferences of citizens, and aggregate them together to determine what social policies the society should adopt."
" Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on voting, where the policy with the most votes gets implemented."
" Under minimalism, democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections."
" According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not ""rule"" because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded."
" Joseph Schumpeter articulated this view most famously in his book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy."
"According to the theory of direct democracy, on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals."
 Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view.
" Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socializes and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites."
" Most importantly, citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies."
Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter—with half to their left and the other half to their right.
 This is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes.
 Anthony Downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments.
 Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book An Economic Theory of Democracy.
" Dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision)."
 He uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy.
 First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society.
" However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation."
" Similarly, Ronald Dworkin argues that ""democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal."
Deliberative democracy is based on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation.
" Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting."
" Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups."
" If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule."
Radical democracy is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society.
" Democracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision-making processes."
"Equality is a state of affairs in which all people within a specific society or isolated group have the same social status, especially socioeconomic status, including protection of human rights and dignity, and equal access to certain social goods and social services."
" Furthermore, it may also include health equality, economic equality and other social securities."
 Social equality requires the absence of legally enforced social class or caste boundaries and the absence of discrimination motivated by an inalienable part of a person's identity.
" To this end there must be equal justice under law, and equal opportunity regardless of, for example, sex, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, origin, caste or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health or disability."
"A common way of understanding politics is through the left–right political spectrum, which ranges from left-wing politics via centrism to right-wing politics."
" This classification is comparatively recent and dates from the French Revolution, when those members of the National Assembly who supported the republic, the common people and a secular society sat on the left and supporters of the monarchy, aristocratic privilege and the Church sat on the right."
"Today, the left is generally progressivist, seeking social progress in society."
" The more extreme elements of the left, named the far-left, tend to support revolutionary means for achieving this."
" The center-left, on the other hand, advocate for more reformist approaches, for example that of social democracy."
"In contrast, the right is generally motivated by conservatism, which seeks to conserve what it sees as the important elements of society."
" The far-right goes beyond this, and often represents a reactionary turn against progress, seeking to undo it."
 Examples of such ideologies have included Fascism and Nazism.
" The center-right may be less clear-cut and more mixed in this regard, with neoconservatives supporting the spread of democracy, and one-nation conservatives more open to social welfare programs."
"According to Norberto Bobbio, one of the major exponents of this distinction, the left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality—believing it to be unethical or unnatural, while the right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian."
"Some ideologies, notably Christian Democracy, claim to combine left and right-wing politics; according to Geoffrey K."
" Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, ""In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles."
""" Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include Fascist Terza Posizione economic politics in Italy and Peronism in Argentina."
Political freedom (also known as political liberty or autonomy) is a central concept in political thought and one of the most important features of democratic societies.
" Negative liberty has been described as freedom from oppression or coercion and unreasonable external constraints on action, often enacted through civil and political rights, while positive liberty is the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions, e."
" This capability approach to freedom requires economic, social and cultural rights in order to be realized."
Authoritarianism and libertarianism disagree the amount of individual freedom each person possesses in that society relative to the state.
" One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where ""individual rights and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities,"" while libertarians generally oppose the state and hold the individual as sovereign."
" In their purest form, libertarians are anarchists, who argue for the total abolition of the state, of political parties and of other political entities, while the purest authoritarians are, by definition, totalitarians who support state control over all aspects of society."
"For instance, classical liberalism (also known as laissez-faire liberalism) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and limited government."
" This includes the importance of human rationality, individual property rights, free markets, natural rights, the protection of civil liberties, constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of John Locke, Adam Smith, David Hume, David Ricardo, Voltaire, Montesquieu and others."
" According to the libertarian Institute for Humane Studies, ""the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary."
" Susan Brown (1993), ""liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual freedom yet differ from one another in very distinct ways."
 Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations.

 On Politics: A History of Political Thought from Herodotus to the Present.
"A politician is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking an elected seat in government."
"  Politicians propose, support, and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people."
" Broadly speaking, a ""politician"" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in the government."
"Politicians are people who are politically active, especially in party politics."
" Positions range from local offices to executive, legislative, and judicial offices of regional and national governments."
" Some elected law enforcement officers, such as sheriffs, are considered politicians."
"Politicians are known for their rhetoric, as in speeches or campaign advertisements."
 They are especially known for using common themes that allow them to develop their political positions in terms familiar to the voters.
" Politicians in the 19th century made heavy use of newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets, as well as posters."
" In the 20th century, they branched into radio and television, making television commercials the single most expensive part of an election campaign."
" In the 21st century, they have become increasingly involved with the social media based on the Internet and smartphones."
"Rumor has always played a major role in politics, with negative rumors about an opponent typically more effective than positive rumors about one's own side."
"Once elected, the politician becomes a Head of Government and has to deal with government officials and government  employees."
" Historically, there has been a subtle conflict between the long-term goals of each side."
" In patronage-based systems, such as the United States and Canada in the 19th century, winning politicians replace the government officials and government employees under the civil services and defence services  with local politicians who formed their base of support, the ""spoils system""."
 Public  Service reform was initiated to eliminate the corruption of civil services and defence services  that were involved.
" However, in many less developed countries, the spoils system is in full-scale operation today."
Mattozzi and Merlo argue that two main career paths are typically followed by politicians in modern democracies.
 They are politicians who work in the political sector until retirement.
" These are politicians who gain a reputation for expertise in controlling certain bureaucracies, then leave politics for a well-paid career in the private sector making use of their political contacts."
"The personal histories of politicians have been frequently studied, as it is presumed that their experiences and characteristics shape their beliefs and behaviors."
 There are four pathways by which a politician's biography could influence their leadership style and abilities.
" The first is that biography may influence one's core beliefs, which are used to shape a worldview."
 The second is that politicians' skills and competence are influenced by personal experience.
 The areas of skill and competence can define where they devote resources and attention as a leader.
 The third pathway is that biographical attributes may define and shape political incentives.
" A leader's previous profession, for example, could be viewed as of higher importance, causing a disproportionate investment of leadership resources to ensure the growth and health of that profession, including former colleagues."
" Other examples besides profession include the politician's innate characteristics, such as race or gender."
" The fourth pathway is how a politician's biography affects their public perception, which can, in turn, affect their leadership style."
" Female politicians, for example, may use different strategies to attract the same level of respect given to male politicians."
"Numerous scholars have studied the characteristics of politicians, comparing those at the local and national levels, and comparing the more liberal or the more conservative ones, and comparing the more successful and less successful in terms of elections."
" In recent years, special attention has focused on the distinctive career path of women politicians."
" For example, there are studies of the ""Supermadre"" model in Latin American politics."
"Many politicians have the knack to remember thousands of names and faces and recall personal anecdotes about their constituents—it is an advantage in the job, rather like being seven-foot tall for a basketball player."
Many critics attack politicians for being out of touch with the public.
" Areas of friction include how politicians speak, which has been described as being overly formal and filled with many euphemistic and metaphorical expressions and commonly perceived as an attempt to ""obscure, mislead, and confuse""."
"In the popular image, politicians are thought of as clueless, selfish, manipulators, liars, incompetents, and corrupt, taking money in exchange for goods or services, rather than working for the general public good."
" Politicians in many countries are regarded as the ""most hated professionals""."
A democratic republic is a form of government operating on principles adopted from a republic and a democracy.
" Rather than being a cross between two entirely separate systems, democratic republics may function on principles shared by both republics and democracies."
"Common definitions of the terms democracy and republic often feature overlapping concerns, suggesting that many democracies function as republics, and many republics operate on democratic principles, as shown by these definitions from the Oxford English Dictionary:
"
"Republic: ""A state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives."
"Democracy: ""A system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives."
"""Eugene Volokh of the UCLA School of Law notes that the United States exemplifies the varied nature of a constitutional republic—a country where some decisions (often local) are made by direct democratic processes, while others (often federal) are made by democratically elected representatives."
" As with many large systems, US governance is incompletely described by any single term."
" It also employs the concept, for instance, of a constitutional democracy in which a court system is involved in matters of jurisprudence."
"As with other democracies, not all persons in a democratic republic are necessarily citizens, and not all citizens are necessarily entitled to vote."
 Suffrage is commonly restricted by criteria such as voting age.
"In the US, the notion that a republic was a form of democracy was common from the time of its founding, and the concepts associated with representative democracy (and hence with a democratic republic) are suggested by John Adams (writing in 1784):No determinations are carried, it is true, in a simple representative democracy, but by consent of the majority or their representatives."
"Historically, some inconsistency around the term is frequent."
" The Republic of China (Taiwan) claims to be the oldest of Asia's democratic republics, though its recent history of democratic process is largely linked only to Taiwan."
" Likewise, Africa's oldest democratic republic, Liberia (formed in 1822), has had its political stability rocked by periodic violence and coups."
"Many countries that use the term ""democratic republic"" in their official names (such as Algeria, Congo-Kinshasa, Ethiopia, North Korea, Laos,  and Nepal) are considered undemocratic ""hybrid regimes"" or ""authoritarian regimes"" by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index and ""not free"" by the U."

"In addition, East Germany was also officially known as the German Democratic Republic, but, like the Somali Democratic Republic, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was controlled by a bureaucratic government espousing Marxism–Leninism."
" Incidentally, the Democratic Republic of Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Sudan were non-Marxist socialist dictatorships that existed during the Cold War."
"There are also countries which use the term ""Democratic Republic"" in the name and have a good track of general election and were rated ""flawed democracy"" or ""full democracy"" in the Democracy Index, such as the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka."
A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city.
" Legislatures form important parts of the most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of parliamentary government."
Laws enacted by legislatures are usually known as primary legislation.
" In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, with authority to amend the budget involved."
" In a democracy, legislators are most commonly popularly elected, although indirect election and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for bicameral legislatures featuring an upper chamber."
The name used to refer to a legislative body varies by country.
"Estates or States (from old French 'condition' or 'status')
"
"Parliament (from French parler 'to speak')Though the specific roles for each legislature differ by location, they all aim to serve the same purpose of appointing officials to represent their citizens to determine appropriate legislation for the country."
Among the earliest recognised legislatures was the Athenian Ecclesia.
" In the Middle Ages, European monarchs would host assemblies of the nobility, which would later develop into predecessors of modern legislatures."
" The oldest surviving legislature is the Icelandic Althing, founded in 930 CE."
"Democratic legislatures have six major functions: representation, deliberation, legislation, authorizing expenditure, making governments, and oversight."
"There exist five ways that representation can be achieved in a legislature:
"
"Formalistically: how the rules of the legislature ensure representation of constituents;
"
"Symbolically: how the constituents perceive their representatives;
"
"Descriptively: how well the composition of the legislature matches the demographics of the wider society;
"
"Substantively: how well representatives actually respond to the needs of their constituents;
"
Collectively: how well the representatives represent the interests of the society as a whole.
One of the major functions of a legislature is to discuss and debate issues of major importance to society.
" In debating legislatures, like Parliament of the United Kingdom, there is lively debate on the floor of the legislature."
" Contrastingly, in committee-based legislatures like the United States Congress, the deliberation takes place in closed committees."
"While legislatures have nominally the sole power to create laws, the substantive extent of this power depends on details of the political system."
" In Westminster-style legislatures the executive (composed of the cabinet) can essentially pass any laws it wants, as it usually has a majority of legislators behind it, kept in check by the party whip, while committee-based legislatures in continental Europe and those in presidential systems of the Americas have more independence in drafting and amending bills."
The origins of the power of the purse which legislatures typically have in passing or denying government budgets goes back to the European assemblies of nobility which the monarchs would have to consult before raising taxes.
" For this power to be actually effective, the legislature should be able to amend the budget, have an effective committee system, enough time for consideration, as well as access to relevant background information."
The power of the legislature over the government is stronger.
"There are several ways in which the legislature can hold the government accountable, including questioning, interpellations, and votes of confidence."
"In contrast to democratic systems, legislatures under authoritarianism are used to ensure the stability of the power structure by co-opting potential competing interests within the elites, which they achieve (cap) by:
"
"Offering a way to recruit new members to the ruling clique;
"
Being a channel through which limited grievances and concessions can be passed.
Each chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of parliamentary procedure to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation.
 There must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities; this is called a quorum.
"Some of the responsibilities of a legislature, such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation, are usually delegated to committees made up of a few of the members of the chamber(s)."
The members of a legislature usually represent different political parties; the members from each party generally meet as a caucus to organize their internal affairs.
"Legislatures vary widely in the amount of political power they wield, compared to other political players such as judiciaries, militaries, and executives."
 Steven Fish and Matthew Kroenig constructed a Parliamentary Powers Index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures.
" The German Bundestag, the Italian Parliament, and the Mongolian State Great Khural tied for most powerful, while Myanmar's House of Representatives and Somalia's Transitional Federal Assembly (since replaced by the Federal Parliament of Somalia) tied for least powerful."
"Some political systems follow the principle of legislative supremacy, which holds that the legislature is the supreme branch of government and cannot be bound by other institutions, such as the judicial branch or a written constitution."
"In parliamentary and semi-presidential systems of government, the executive is responsible to the legislature, which may remove it with a vote of no confidence."
" On the other hand, according to the separation of powers doctrine, the legislature in a presidential system is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the judiciary and the executive."
" Nevertheless, many presidential systems provide for the impeachment of the executive for criminal or unconstitutional behaviour."
Legislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to administrative or executive agencies.
"Legislatures are made up of individual members, known as legislators, who vote on proposed laws."
" A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of ""seats"" it contains."
" For example, a legislature that has 100 ""seats"" has 100 members."
" By extension, an electoral district that elects a single legislator can also be described as a ""seat"", as, for, example, in the phrases ""safe seat"" and ""marginal seat""."
"After election, the members may be protected by parliamentary immunity or parliamentary privilege, either for all actions the duration of their entire term, or for just those related to their legislative duties."
"A legislature may debate and vote upon bills as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate assemblies, called by various names including legislative chambers, debate chambers, and houses, which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers."
" A legislature which operates as a single unit is unicameral, one divided into two chambers is bicameral, and one divided into three chambers is tricameral."
"In bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the upper house, while the other is considered the lower house."
" The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by administrative divisions rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house."
" In some systems, particularly parliamentary systems, the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly federal presidential systems, the upper house has equal or even greater power."
"In federations, the upper house typically represents the federation's component states."
 This is also the case with the supranational legislature of the European Union.
" The upper house may either contain the delegates of state governments – as in the European Union and in Germany and, before 1913, in the United States – or be elected according to a formula that grants equal representation to states with smaller populations, as is the case in Australia and the United States since 1913."
"Tricameral legislatures are rare; the Massachusetts Governor's Council still exists, but the most recent national example existed in the waning years of White-minority rule in South Africa."
" Tetracameral legislatures no longer exist, but they were previously used in Scandinavia."
" Among national legislatures, China's National People's Congress is the largest with 2,980 members, while Vatican City's Pontifical Commission is the smallest with 7."
 Neither legislature is democratically elected: The Pontifical Commission members are appointed by the Pope and the National People's Congress is indirectly elected within the context of a one-party state.
"Legislature size is a trade off between efficiency and representation; the smaller the legislature, the more efficiently it can operate, but the larger the legislature, the better it can represent the political diversity of its constituents."
" Comparative analysis of national legislatures has found that size of a country's lower house tends to be proportional to the cube root of its population; that is, the size of the lower house tends to increase along with population, but much more slowly."
"In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative body of government."
" Generally, a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries."
" The term is similar to the idea of a senate, synod or congress, and is commonly used in countries that are current or former monarchies, a form of government with a monarch as the head."
" Some contexts restrict the use of the word parliament to parliamentary systems, although it is also used to describe the legislature in some presidential systems (e."
" the Parliament of Ghana), even where it is not in the official name."
"Historically, parliaments included various kinds of deliberative, consultative, and judicial assemblies, e."
"The English term is derived from Anglo-Norman and dates to the 14th century, coming from the 11th century Old French parlement, from parler, meaning ""to talk""."
" The meaning evolved over time, originally referring to any discussion, conversation, or negotiation through various kinds of deliberative or judicial groups, often summoned by a monarch."
" By the 15th century, in Britain, it had come to specifically mean the legislature."
"Since ancient times, when societies were tribal, there were councils or a headman whose decisions were assessed by village elders."
 Some scholars suggest that in ancient Mesopotamia there was a primitive democratic government where the kings were assessed by council.
" The same has been said about ancient India, where some form of deliberative assemblies existed, and therefore there was some form of democracy."
" However, these claims are not accepted by most scholars, who see these forms of government as oligarchies."
" The Athenian assembly (ἐκκλησία, ekklesia) was the most important institution, and every free male citizen could take part in the discussions."
" However, Athenian democracy was not representative, but rather direct, and therefore the ekklesia was different from the parliamentary system."
"The Roman Republic had legislative assemblies, who had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of new statutes, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances."
" The Roman Senate controlled money, administration, and the details of foreign policy."
Some Muslim scholars argue that the Islamic shura (a method of taking decisions in Islamic societies) is analogous to the parliament.
" However, others highlight what they consider fundamental differences between the shura system and the parliamentary system."
"Although there are documented councils held in 873, 1020, 1050 and 1063, there was no representation of commoners."
" What is considered to be the first parliament (with the presence of commoners), the Cortes of León, was held in the Kingdom of León in 1188."
" According to the UNESCO, the Decreta of Leon of 1188 is the oldest documentary manifestation of the European parliamentary system."
" In addition, UNESCO granted the 1188 Cortes of Alfonso IX the title of ""Memory of the World"" and the city of Leon has been recognized as the ""Cradle of Parliamentarism""."
"After coming to power, King Alfonso IX, facing an attack by his two neighbors, Castile and Portugal, decided to summon the ""Royal Curia""."
" This was a medieval organization composed of aristocrats and bishops but because of the seriousness of the situation and the need to maximize political support, Alfonso IX took the decision to also call the representatives of the urban middle class from the most important cities of the kingdom to the assembly."
" León's Cortes dealt with matters like the right to private property, the inviolability of domicile, the right to appeal to justice opposite the King and the obligation of the King to consult the Cortes before entering a war."
" Prelates, nobles and commoners met separately in the three estates of the Cortes."
" In this meeting, new laws were approved to protect commoners against the arbitrarities of nobles, prelates and the king."
 This important set of laws is known as the Carta Magna Leonesa.
"Following this event, new Cortes would appear in the other different territories that would make up Spain: Principality of Catalonia in 1192, the Kingdom of Castile in 1250, Kingdom of Aragon in 1274, Kingdom of Valencia in 1283 and Kingdom of Navarre in 1300."
"After the union of the Kingdoms of Leon and Castile under the Crown of Castile, their Cortes were united as well in 1258."
" The Castilian Cortes had representatives from Burgos, Toledo, León, Seville, Córdoba, Murcia, Jaén, Zamora, Segovia, Ávila, Salamanca, Cuenca, Toro, Valladolid, Soria, Madrid, Guadalajara and Granada (after 1492)."
"  The Cortes' assent was required to pass new taxes, and could also advise the king on other matters."
"  The comunero rebels intended a stronger role for the Cortes, but were defeated by the forces of Habsburg Emperor Charles V in 1521."
"  The Cortes maintained some power, however, though it became more of a consultative entity."
"  However, by the time of King Philip II, Charles's son, the Castilian Cortes had come under functionally complete royal control, with its delegates dependent on the Crown for their income."
The Cortes of the Crown of Aragon kingdoms retained their power to control the king's spending with regard to the finances of those kingdoms.
" But after the War of the Spanish Succession and the victory of another royal house – the Bourbons – and King Philip V, their Cortes were suppressed (those of Aragon and Valencia in 1707, and those of Catalonia and the Balearic islands in 1714)."
"The very first Cortes representing the whole of Spain (and the Spanish empire of the day) assembled in 1812, in Cadiz, where it operated as a government in exile as at that time most of the rest of Spain was in the hands of Napoleon's army."
"After its self-proclamation as an independent kingdom in 1139 by Afonso I of Portugal (followed by the recognition by the Kingdom of León in the Treaty of Zamora of 1143), the first historically established Cortes of the Kingdom of Portugal occurred in 1211 in Coimbra by initiative of Afonso II of Portugal."
" These established the first general laws of the kingdom (Leis Gerais do Reino): protection of the king's property, stipulation of measures for the administration of justice and the rights of his subjects to be protected from abuses by royal officials, and confirming the clerical donations of the previous king Sancho I of Portugal."
" These Cortes also affirmed the validity of canon law for the Church in Portugal, while introducing the prohibition of the purchase of lands by churches or monasteries (although they can be acquired by donations and legacies)."
"After the conquest of Algarve in 1249, the Kingdom of Portugal completed its Reconquista."
" In 1254 King Afonso III of Portugal summoned Portuguese Cortes in Leiria, with the inclusion of burghers from old and newly incorporated municipalities."
 This inclusion establishes the Cortes of Leiria of 1254 as the second sample of modern parliamentarism in the history of Europe (after the Cortes of León in 1188).
 In these Cortes the monetagio was introduced: a fixed sum was to be paid by the burghers to the Crown as a substitute for the septennium (the traditional revision of the face value of coinage by the Crown every seven years).
" These Cortes also introduced staple laws on the Douro River, favoring the new royal city of Vila Nova de Gaia at the expense of the old episcopal city of Porto."
"The Portuguese Cortes met again under King Afonso III of Portugal in 1256, 1261 and 1273, always by royal summon."
" Medieval Kings of Portugal continued to rely on small assemblies of notables, and only summoned the full Cortes on extraordinary occasions."
" A Cortes would be called if the king wanted to introduce new taxes, change some fundamental laws, announce significant shifts in foreign policy (e."
" ratify treaties), or settle matters of royal succession, issues where the cooperation and assent of the towns was thought necessary."
" Changing taxation (especially requesting war subsidies), was probably the most frequent reason for convening the Cortes."
" As the nobles and clergy were largely tax-exempt, setting taxation involved intensive negotiations between the royal council and the burgher delegates at the Cortes."
"Delegates (procuradores) not only considered the king's proposals, but, in turn, also used the Cortes to submit petitions of their own to the royal council on a myriad of matters, e."
" extending and confirming town privileges, punishing abuses of officials, introducing new price controls, constraints on Jews, pledges on coinage, etc."
" The royal response to these petitions became enshrined as ordinances and statutes, thus giving the Cortes the aspect of a legislature."
 These petitions were originally referred to as aggravamentos (grievances) then artigos (articles) and eventually capitulos (chapters).
" In a Cortes-Gerais, petitions were discussed and voted upon separately by each estate and required the approval of at least two of the three estates before being passed up to the royal council."
 The proposal was then subject to royal veto (either accepted or rejected by the king in its entirety) before becoming law.
"Nonetheless, the exact extent of Cortes power was ambiguous."
 Kings insisted on their ancient prerogative to promulgate laws independently of the Cortes.
" The compromise, in theory, was that ordinances enacted in Cortes could only be modified or repealed by Cortes."
 But even that principle was often circumvented or ignored in practice.
"The Cortes probably had their heyday in the 14th and 15th centuries, reaching their apex when John I of Portugal relied almost wholly upon the bourgeoisie for his power."
" For a period after the 1383–1385 Crisis, the Cortes were convened almost annually."
" Portuguese monarchs, tapping into the riches of the Portuguese empire overseas, grew less dependent on Cortes subsidies and convened them less frequently."
"1481-1495) used them to break the high nobility, but dispensed with them otherwise."
"Curiously, the Cortes gained a new importance with the Iberian Union of 1581, finding a role as the representative of Portuguese interests to the new Habsburg monarch."
" The Cortes played a critical role in the 1640 Restoration, and enjoyed a brief period of resurgence during the reign of John IV of Portugal (r."
" But by the end of the 17th century, it found itself sidelined once again."
" The last Cortes met in 1698, for the mere formality of confirming the appointment of Infante John (future John V of Portugal) as the successor of Peter II of Portugal."
" Thereafter, Portuguese kings ruled as absolute monarchs and no Cortes were assembled for over a century."
" This state of affairs came to an end with the Liberal Revolution of 1820, which set in motion the introduction of a new constitution, and a permanent and proper parliament, that however inherited the name of Cortes Gerais."
England has long had a tradition of a body of men who would assist and advise the king on important matters.
" Under the Anglo-Saxon kings, there was an advisory council, the Witenagemot."
" The name derives from the Old English ƿitena ȝemōt, or witena gemōt, for ""meeting of wise men""."
 The first recorded act of a witenagemot was the law code issued by King Æthelberht of Kent ca.
" 600, the earliest document which survives in sustained Old English prose; however, the witan was certainly in existence long before this time."
" The Witan, along with the folkmoots (local assemblies), is an important ancestor of the modern English parliament."
"As part of the Norman Conquest, the new king, William I, did away with the Witenagemot, replacing it with a Curia Regis (""King's Council"")."
" Membership of the Curia was largely restricted to the tenants in chief, the few nobles who ""rented"" great estates directly from the king, along with ecclesiastics."
" William brought to England the feudal system of his native Normandy, and sought the advice of the curia regis before making laws."
" This is the original body from which the Parliament, the higher courts of law, and the Privy Council and Cabinet descend."
" Of these, the legislature is formally the High Court of Parliament; judges sit in the Supreme Court of Judicature."
 Only the executive government is no longer conducted in a royal court.
Most historians date the emergence of a parliament with some degree of power to which the throne had to defer no later than the rule of Edward I.
"  Like previous kings, Edward called leading nobles and church leaders to discuss government matters, especially finance and taxation."
 A meeting in 1295 became known as the Model Parliament because it set the pattern for later Parliaments.
" The significant difference between the Model Parliament and the earlier Curia Regis was the addition of the Commons; that is, the inclusion of elected representatives of rural landowners and of townsmen."
" In 1307, Edward I agreed not to collect certain taxes without the ""consent of the realm"" through parliament."
The tenants-in-chief often struggled with their spiritual counterparts and with the king for power.
" In 1215, they secured from King John of England Magna Carta, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of a council."
" It was also established that the most important tenants-in-chief and ecclesiastics be summoned to the council by personal writs from the sovereign, and that all others be summoned to the council by general writs from the sheriffs of their counties."
 Modern government has its origins in the Curia Regis; parliament descends from the Great Council later known as the parliamentum established by Magna Carta.
"During the reign of King Henry III, 13th-Century English Parliaments incorporated elected representatives from shires and towns."
" These parliaments are, as such, considered forerunners of the modern parliament."
"In 1265, Simon de Montfort, then in rebellion against Henry III, summoned a parliament of his supporters without royal authorization."
" The archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and barons were summoned, as were two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough."
" Knights had been summoned to previous councils, but it was unprecedented for the boroughs to receive any representation."
" Come 1295, Edward I later adopted de Montfort's ideas for representation and election in the so-called ""Model Parliament""."
" At first, each estate debated independently; by the reign of Edward III, however, Parliament recognisably assumed its modern form, with authorities dividing the legislative body into two separate chambers."
The purpose and structure of Parliament in Tudor England underwent a significant transformation under the reign of Henry VIII.
" Originally its methods were primarily medieval, and the monarch still possessed a form of inarguable dominion over its decisions."
" According to Elton, it was Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, then chief minister to Henry VIII, who initiated still other changes within parliament."
The Reformation Acts supplied Parliament with unlimited power over the country.
" This included authority over virtually every matter, whether social, economic, political, or religious; it legalised the Reformation, officially and indisputably."
" The king had to rule through the council, not over it, and all sides needed to reach a mutual agreement when creating or passing laws, adjusting or implementing taxes, or changing religious doctrines."
 This was significant: the monarch no longer had sole control over the country.
" For instance, during the later years of Mary, Parliament exercised its authority in originally rejecting Mary's bid to revive Catholicism in the realm."
" Later on, the legislative body even denied Elizabeth her request to marry."
" If Parliament had possessed this power before Cromwell, such as when Wolsey served as secretary, the Reformation may never have happened, as the king would have had to gain the consent of all parliament members before so drastically changing the country's religious laws and fundamental identity."
The power of Parliament increased considerably after the Civil War.
" More stability, in turn, helped assure more effective management, organisation, and efficiency."
 Parliament printed statutes and devised a more coherent parliamentary procedure.
The rise of Parliament proved especially important in the sense that it limited the repercussions of dynastic complications that had so often plunged England into civil war.
" Parliament still ran the country even in the absence of suitable heirs to the throne, and its legitimacy as a decision-making body reduced the royal prerogatives of kings like Henry VIII and the importance of their whims."
" For example, Henry VIII could not simply establish supremacy by proclamation; he required Parliament to enforce statutes and add felonies and treasons."
 An important liberty for Parliament was its freedom of speech; Henry allowed anything to be spoken openly within Parliament and speakers could not face arrest – a fact which they exploited incessantly.
" Nevertheless, Parliament in Henry VIII's time offered up very little objection to the monarch's desires."
" Under his and Edward's reign, the legislative body complied willingly with the majority of the kings' decisions."
Much of this compliance stemmed from how the English viewed and traditionally understood authority.
" As Williams described it, ""King and parliament were not separate entities, but a single body, of which the monarch was the senior partner and the Lords and the Commons the lesser, but still essential, members."
"Although its role in government expanded significantly during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, the Parliament of England saw some of its most important gains in the 17th century."
 A series of conflicts between the Crown and Parliament culminated in the execution of King Charles I in 1649.
" Afterward, England became a commonwealth, with Oliver Cromwell, its lord protector, the de facto ruler."
" Frustrated with its decisions, Cromwell purged and suspended Parliament on several occasions."
"A controversial figure accused of despotism, war crimes, and even genocide, Cromwell is nonetheless regarded as essential to the growth of democracy in England."
" The years of the Commonwealth, coupled with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the subsequent Glorious Revolution of 1688, helped reinforce and strengthen Parliament as an institution separate from the Crown."
The Parliament of England met until it merged with the Parliament of Scotland under the Acts of Union.
 This union created the new Parliament of Great Britain in 1707.
"From the 10th century the Kingdom of Alba was ruled by chiefs (toisechs) and subkings (mormaers) under the suzerainty, real or nominal, of a High King."
" Popular assemblies, as in Ireland, were involved in law-making, and sometimes in king-making, although the introduction of tanistry—naming a successor in the lifetime of a king—made the second less than common."
" These early assemblies cannot be considered ""parliaments"" in the later sense of the word, and were entirely separate from the later, Norman-influenced, institution."
The Parliament of Scotland evolved during the Middle Ages from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls.
" The unicameral parliament is first found on record, referred to as a colloquium, in 1235 at Kirkliston (a village now in Edinburgh)."
"By the early fourteenth century the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 burgh commissioners attended."
" Consisting of the Three Estates; of clerics, lay tenants-in-chief and burgh commissioners sitting in a single chamber, the Scottish parliament acquired significant powers over particular issues."
" Most obviously it was needed for consent for taxation (although taxation was only raised irregularly in Scotland in the medieval period), but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic."
" Parliamentary business was also carried out by ""sister"" institutions, before c."
 1500 by General Council and thereafter by the Convention of Estates.
" These could carry out much business also dealt with by Parliament – taxation, legislation and policy-making – but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament."
"The parliament, which is also referred to as the Estates of Scotland, the Three Estates, the Scots Parliament or the auld Scots Parliament (Eng: old), met until the Acts of Union merged the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England, creating the new Parliament of Great Britain in 1707."
"Following the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum, and the passing of the Scotland Act 1998 by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament was reconvened on 1 July 1999, although with much more limited powers than its 18th-century predecessor."
" The parliament has sat since 2004 at its newly constructed Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh, situated at the foot of the Royal Mile, next to the royal palace of Holyroodhouse."
"A thing or ting (Old Norse and Icelandic: þing; other modern Scandinavian: ting, ding in Dutch) was the governing assembly in Germanic societies, made up of the free men of the community and presided by lawspeakers."
"The thing was the assembly of the free men of a country, province or a hundred (hundare/härad/herred)."
" There were consequently, hierarchies of things, so that the local things were represented at the thing for a larger area, for a province or land."
" At the thing, disputes were solved and political decisions were made."
 The place for the thing was often also the place for public religious rites and for commerce.
"The thing met at regular intervals, legislated, elected chieftains and kings, and judged according to the law, which was memorised and recited by the ""law speaker"" (the judge)."
"The Icelandic, Faroese and Manx parliaments trace their origins back to the Viking expansion originating from the Petty kingdoms of Norway as well as Denmark, replicating Viking government systems in the conquered territories, such as those represented by the Gulating near Bergen in western Norway."
"Later national diets with chambers for different estates developed, e."
" in Sweden and in Finland (which was part of Sweden until 1809), each with a House of Knights for the nobility."
" In both these countries, the national parliaments are now called riksdag (in Finland also eduskunta), a word used since the Middle Ages and equivalent of the German word Reichstag."
"Today the term lives on in the official names of national legislatures, political and judicial institutions in the North-Germanic countries."
" In the Yorkshire and former Danelaw areas of England, which were subject to much Norse invasion and settlement, the wapentake was another name for the same institution."
"The Sicilian Parliament, dating to 1097, evolved as the legislature of the Kingdom of Sicily."
"The Federal Diet of Switzerland was one of the longest-lived representative bodies in history, continuing from the 13th century to 1848."
"Originally, there was only the Parliament of Paris, born out of the Curia Regis in 1307, and located inside the medieval royal palace, now the Paris Hall of Justice."
 The jurisdiction of the Parliament of Paris covered the entire kingdom.
" In 1443, following the turmoil of the Hundred Years' War, King Charles VII of France granted Languedoc its own parliament by establishing the Parliament of Toulouse, the first parliament outside of Paris, whose jurisdiction extended over the most part of southern France."
" From 1443 until the French Revolution several other parliaments were created in some provinces of France (Grenoble, Bordeaux)."
All the parliaments could issue regulatory decrees for the application of royal edicts or of customary practices; they could also refuse to register laws that they judged contrary to fundamental law or simply as being untimely.
" Parliamentary power in France was suppressed more so than in England as a result of absolutism, and parliaments were eventually overshadowed by the larger Estates General, up until the French Revolution, when the National Assembly became the lower house of France's bicameral legislature."
"The  Diet of Hungary or originally: Parlamentum Publicum / Parlamentum Generale (Hungarian: Országgyűlés) became the supreme legislative institution in the medieval kingdom of Hungary from the 1290s, and in its successor states, Royal Hungary and the Habsburg kingdom of Hungary throughout the Early Modern period."
" The name of the legislative body was originally ""Parlamentum"" during the Middle Ages, the ""Diet"" expression gained mostly in the Early Modern period."
" It convened at regular intervals with interruptions during the period of 1527 to 1918, and again until 1946."
Some researchers have traced the roots of the Hungarian institution of national assemblies as far back as the 11th century.
" This based on documentary evidence that, on certain ""important occasions"" under the reigns of King Ladislaus I and King Coloman ""the Learned"", assemblies were held on a national scale where both ecclesiastic and secular dignitaries made appearances."
"The first exact written mention of the word ""parlamentum"" (Parliament) for the nation-wide assembly originated during the reign of King Andrew II in the Golden Bull of 1222, which reaffirmed the rights of the smaller nobles of the old and new classes of royal servants (servientes regis) against both the crown and the magnates, and to defend the rights of the whole nation against the crown by restricting the powers of the latter in certain fields and legalizing refusal to obey its unlawful/unconstitutional commands (the ""ius resistendi"")."
"The lesser nobles also began to present Andrew with grievances, a practice that evolved into the institution of the Hungarian Diet."
An institutionalized Hungarian parliament emerged during the 14th and 15th centuries.
" Beginning under King Charles I, continuing under subsequent kings through into the reign of King Matthias I, the Diet was essentially convened by the king."
" However, under the rule of heavy handed kings like Louis the Great and during reign of the early absolutist Matthias Corvinus the parliaments were often convened to announce the royal decisions, and had no significant power of its own."
" Since the reign of the Jagiellonian dynasty, the parliament has regained most of its former power."
"According to the Chronicles of Gallus Anonymus, the first legendary Polish ruler, Siemowit, who began the Piast Dynasty, was chosen by a wiec."
" The veche (Russian: вече, Polish: wiec) was a popular assembly in medieval Slavic countries, and in late medieval period, a parliament."
" The idea of the wiec led in 1182 to the development of the Polish parliament, the Sejm."
"The term ""sejm"" comes from an old Polish expression denoting a meeting of the populace."
" The power of early sejms grew between 1146–1295, when the power of individual rulers waned and various councils and wiece grew stronger."
" Since the 14th century irregular sejms (described in various Latin sources as contentio generalis, conventio magna, conventio solemna, parlamentum, parlamentum generale, dieta or Polish sejm walny) have been called by Polish kings."
" From 1374, the king had to receive sejm permission to raise taxes."
" The General Sejm (Polish Sejm Generalny or Sejm Walny), first convoked by the king John I Olbracht in 1493 near Piotrków, evolved from earlier regional and provincial meetings (sejmiks)."
" It followed most closely the sejmik generally, which arose from the 1454 Nieszawa Statutes, granted to the szlachta (nobles) by King Casimir IV the Jagiellonian."
" From 1493 forward, indirect elections were repeated every two years."
 With the development of the unique Polish Golden Liberty the Sejm's powers increased.
 Poland was among the few countries in Europe where the parliament played an especially important role - it was the Sejm that contributed the most to uniting the nation and the state.
"The Commonwealth's general parliament consisted of three estates: the King of Poland (who also acted as the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Russia/Ruthenia, Prussia, Mazovia, etc."
"), the Senat (consisting of Ministers, Palatines, Castellans and Bishops) and the Chamber of Envoys—circa 170 nobles (szlachta) acting on behalf of their Lands and sent by Land Parliaments."
 Also representatives of selected cities but without any voting powers.
 Since 1573 at a royal election all peers of the Commonwealth could participate in the Parliament and become the King's electors.
Cossack Rada was the legislative body of a military republic of the Ukrainian Cossacks that grew rapidly in the 15th century from serfs fleeing the more controlled parts of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth.
 The republic did not regard social origin/nobility and accepted all people who declared to be Orthodox Christians.
"Originally established at the Zaporizhian Sich, the rada (council) was an institution of Cossack administration in Ukraine from the 16th to the 18th century."
" With the establishment of the Hetman state in 1648, it was officially known as the General Military Council until 1750."
"The zemsky sobor (Russian: зе́мский собо́р) was the first Russian parliament of the feudal Estates type, in the 16th and 17th centuries."
"It could be summoned either by tsar, or patriarch, or the Boyar Duma."
" Three categories of population, comparable to the Estates-General of France but with the numbering of the first two Estates reversed, participated in the assembly:
"
"Nobility and high bureaucracy, including the Boyar DumaThe Holy Sobor of high Orthodox clergyRepresentatives of merchants and townspeople (third estate)The name of the parliament of nowadays Russian Federation is the Federal Assembly of Russia."
" The term for its lower house, State Duma (which is better known than the Federal Assembly itself, and is often mistaken for the entirety of the parliament) comes from the Russian word думать (dumat),  ""to think""."
 The Boyar Duma was an advisory council to the grand princes and tsars of Muscovy.
" The Duma was discontinued by Peter the Great, who transferred its functions to the Governing Senate in 1711."
The veche was the highest legislature and judicial authority in the republic of Novgorod until 1478.
" In its sister state, Pskov, a separate veche operated until 1510."
"Since the Novgorod revolution of 1137 ousted the ruling grand prince, the veche became the supreme state authority."
" After the reforms of 1410, the veche was restructured on a model similar to that of Venice, becoming the Commons chamber of the parliament."
" An upper Senate-like Council of Lords was also created, with title membership for all former city magistrates."
" Some sources indicate that veche membership may have become full-time, and parliament deputies were now called vechniks."
"  It is recounted that the Novgorod assembly could be summoned by anyone who rung the veche bell, although it is more likely that the common procedure was more complex."
 This bell was a symbol of republican sovereignty and independence.
" The whole population of the city—boyars, merchants, and common citizens—then gathered at Yaroslav's Court."
 Separate assemblies could be held in the districts of Novgorod.
 In Pskov the veche assembled in the court of the Trinity cathedral.
"""Conciliarism"" or the ""conciliar movement"", was a reform movement in the 14th and 15th century Roman Catholic Church which held that final authority in spiritual matters resided with the Roman Church as corporation of Christians, embodied by a general church council, not with the pope."
" In effect, the movement sought – ultimately, in vain – to create an All-Catholic Parliament."
 Its struggle with the Papacy had many points in common with the struggle of parliaments in specific countries against the authority of Kings and other secular rulers.
The development of the modern concept of parliamentary government dates back to the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1800).
"The British Parliament is often referred to as the Mother of Parliaments (in fact a misquotation of John Bright, who remarked in 1865 that ""England is the Mother of Parliaments"") because the British Parliament has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments."
" Many nations with parliaments have to some degree emulated the British ""three-tier"" model known as the Westminster system."
" Most countries in Europe and the Commonwealth have similarly organised parliaments with a largely ceremonial head of state who formally opens and closes parliament, a large elected lower house and a smaller, upper house."
The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 by the Acts of Union that replaced the former parliaments of England and Scotland.
 A further union in 1801 united the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland into a Parliament of the United Kingdom.
"In the United Kingdom, Parliament consists of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Monarch."
 The House of Commons is composed of 650 (soon to be 600) members who are directly elected by British citizens to represent single-member constituencies.
" The leader of a Party that wins more than half the seats, or less than half but is able to gain the support of smaller parties to achieve a majority in the house is invited by the Monarch to form a government."
" The House of Lords is a body of long-serving, unelected members: Lords Temporal – 92 of whom inherit their titles (and of whom 90 are elected internally by members of the House to lifetime seats), 588 of whom have been appointed to lifetime seats, and Lords Spiritual – 26 bishops, who are part of the house while they remain in office."
Legislation can originate from either the Lords or the Commons.
" It is voted on in several distinct stages, called readings, in each house."
 Third reading is detailed consideration of clauses of the bill.
In addition to the three readings a bill also goes through a committee stage where it is considered in great detail.
 Once the bill has been passed by one house it goes to the other and essentially repeats the process.
 If after the two sets of readings there are disagreements between the versions that the two houses passed it is returned to the first house for consideration of the amendments made by the second.
 If it passes through the amendment stage Royal Assent is granted and the bill becomes law as an Act of Parliament.
The House of Lords is the less powerful of the two houses as a result of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949.
 These Acts removed the veto power of the Lords over a great deal of legislation.
 If a bill is certified by the Speaker of the House of Commons as a money bill (i.
 acts raising taxes and similar) then the Lords can only block it for a month.
 If an ordinary bill originates in the Commons the Lords can only block it for a maximum of one session of Parliament.
 The exceptions to this rule are things like bills to prolong the life of a Parliament beyond five years.
"In addition to functioning as the second chamber of Parliament, the House of Lords was also the final court of appeal for much of the law of the United Kingdom—a combination of judicial and legislative function that recalls its origin in the Curia Regis."
 This changed in October 2009 when the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom opened and acquired the former jurisdiction of the House of Lords.
"Since 1999, there has been a Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, and, since 2020, a Senedd—or Welsh Parliament—in Cardiff."
" However, these national, unicameral legislatures do not have complete power over their respective countries of the United Kingdom, holding only those powers devolved to them by Westminster from 1997."
" They cannot legislate on defence issues, currency, or national taxation (e."
" Additionally, the bodies can be theoretically dissolved, at any given time, by the British Parliament without the consent of the devolved government."
"In Sweden, the half-century period of parliamentary government beginning with Charles XII's death in 1718 and ending with Gustav III's self-coup in 1772 is known as the Age of Liberty."
" During this period, civil rights were expanded and power shifted from the monarch to parliament."
"While suffrage did not become universal, the taxed peasantry was represented in Parliament, although with little influence and commoners without taxed property had no suffrage at all."
Changes in Poland’s internal situation in the 1980s led to the Round Table Talks which ended in the signing of the famous Round Table Agreement on 5 April 1989.
 The Agreement spearheaded the evolutionary transformation of the country’s political system; independence was regained once again.
 The document Position on Political Reforms provided grounds for amending the Constitution.
 The amended Constitution restored the office of the President of the Polish People’s Republic and the Senate – both to be elected in free and democratic elections.
" In the Sejm, the opposition was allocated 35% of the mandates."
 Thus the so called “contract” elections could not be fully democratic.
 The Sejm (first chamber) became superior to the Senate (second chamber).
" In addition, the institution of National Assembly was established, consisting of the Sejm and the Senate sitting jointly to elect the President of the Polish People’s Republic."
" A declaration of the Solidarity Citizens’ Committee heralded the prompt enactment of a new, democratic constitution and electoral law."
" As a result of Solidarity’s success in elections to the Sejm and the Senate, profound reforms of the political system were undertaken by adopting an amendment to the Constitution on 29 December 1989."
" In the Constitution, the Republic of Poland was defined as a democratic state ruled by law."
" As the provisional constitution lasted too long, it was decided to adopt a provisional regulation in the form of the so called Small Constitution."
" The Small Constitution regulated above all the relationship between the executive and legislative powers, on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers."
"After long years of legislative work, on 2 April 1997, the National Assembly adopted The Constitution of the Republic of Poland."
 The new Constitution introduced a “rationalised” parliamentary-cabinet system in Poland.
 The act defined the position of the Sejm and the Senate within the system without using the term “parliament”.
" It adopted the doctrine of separation of powers, which provided for a balance between the legislative and executive powers."
 In practice the binding provisions of the Constitution ensure the supremacy of the legislative power.
" Both chambers are autonomous bodies, independent of each other, with their own powers."
 The Constitution retained the principle of bicameralism of the legislature.
 The Sejm and the Senate sitting jointly constitute the National Assembly.
" Characteristically, the new Constitution conferred very extensive powers on the Sejm."
" On the other hand, the powers of the Senate are limited, as in the Constitutions of 1921 and 1992."
"Many parliaments are part of a parliamentary system of government, in which the executive is constitutionally answerable to the parliament."
" Some restrict the use of the word parliament to parliamentary systems, while others use the word for any elected legislative body."
" Parliaments usually consist of chambers or houses, and are usually either bicameral or unicameral although more complex models exist, or have existed (see Tricameralism)."
"In some parliamentary systems, the prime minister is a member of the parliament (e."
" They are commonly the leader of the majority party in the lower house of parliament, but only hold the office as long as the ""confidence of the house"" is maintained."
" If members of the lower house lose faith in the leader for whatever reason, they can call a vote of no confidence and force the prime minister to resign."
"This can be particularly dangerous to a government when the distribution of seats among different parties is relatively even, in which case a new election is often called shortly thereafter."
" However, in case of general discontent with the head of government, their replacement can be made very smoothly without all the complications that it represents in the case of a presidential system."
"The parliamentary system can be contrasted with a presidential system, such as the American congressional system, which operates under a stricter separation of powers, whereby the executive does not form part of, nor is it appointed by, the parliamentary or legislative body."
" In such a system, congresses do not select or dismiss heads of governments, and governments cannot request an early dissolution as may be the case for parliaments."
" Some states, such as France, have a semi-presidential system which falls between parliamentary and congressional systems, combining a powerful head of state (president) with a head of government, the prime minister, who is responsible to parliament."

An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office.
Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.
" Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government."
" This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations."
"The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were not used were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot."
"Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems."
 Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).
"To elect means ""to select or make a decision"", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States."
"Elections were used as early in history as ancient Greece and ancient Rome, and throughout the Medieval period to select rulers such as the Holy Roman Emperor (see imperial election) and the pope (see papal election)."
"In Vedic period of India, the Raja (chiefs) of a gaṇa (a tribal organization) was apparently elected by the gana."
" The Raja always belonged to the Kshatriya varna (warrior class), and was typically a son of the previous Raja."
" However, the gana members had the final say in his elections."
 Even during the Sangam Period people elected their representatives by casting their votes and the ballot boxes (Usually a pot) were tied by rope and sealed.
 750s–770s CE) in early medieval Bengal was elected by a group of feudal chieftains.
 Such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region.
" In the Chola Empire, around 920 CE, in Uthiramerur (in present-day Tamil Nadu), palm leaves were used for selecting the village committee members."
" The leaves, with candidate names written on them, were put inside a mud pot."
" To select the committee members, a young boy was asked to take out as many leaves as the number of positions available."
"The first recorded popular elections of officials to public office, by majority vote, where all citizens were eligible both to vote and to hold public office, date back to the Ephors of Sparta in 754 B."
" Athenian democratic elections, where all citizens could hold public office, were not introduced for another 247 years, until the reforms of Cleisthenes."
"), all Athenian citizens were eligible to vote in the popular assemblies, on matters of law and policy, and as jurors, but only the three highest classes of citizens could vote in elections."
" Nor were the lowest of the four classes of Athenian citizens (as defined by the extent of their wealth and property, rather than by birth) eligible to hold public office, through the reforms of Solon."
" The Spartan election of the Ephors, therefore, also predates the reforms of Solon in Athens by approximately 180 years."
"Questions of suffrage, especially suffrage for minority groups, have dominated the history of elections."
" Males, the dominant cultural group in North America and Europe, often dominated the electorate and continue to do so in many countries."
 Early elections in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States were dominated by landed or ruling class males.
" However, by 1920 all Western European and North American democracies had universal adult male suffrage (except Switzerland) and many countries began to consider women's suffrage."
" Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males, political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections (see civil rights movement)."
The question of who may vote is a central issue in elections.
" The electorate does not generally include the entire population; for example, many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting, all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting."
"In Australia, Aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 (see 1967 referendum entry) and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for 3 years or more to vote (a large proportion of which were Aboriginal Australians)."
"Suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country, though further limits may be imposed."
"However, in the European Union, one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an EU citizen; the nationality of the country of residence is not required."
"In some countries, voting is required by law; if an eligible voter does not cast a vote, he or she may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine."
" In Western Australia, the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a $20."
"Historically the size of eligible voters, the electorate, was small having the size of groups or communities of privileged men like aristocrats and men of a city (citizens)."
"With the growth of the number of people with bourgeois citizen rights outside of cities, expanding the term citizen, the electorates grew to numbers beyond the thousands."
"Elections with an electorate in the hundred thousands appeared in the final decades of the Roman Republic, by extending voting rights to citizens outside of Rome with the Lex Julia of 90 BC, reaching an electorate of 910,000 and estimated voter turnout of maximum 10% in 70 BC, only again comparable in size to the first elections of the United States."
" At the same time the Kingdom of Great Britain had in 1780 about 214,000 eligible voters, 3% of the whole population."
A representative democracy requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office.
" In many cases, nomination for office is mediated through preselection processes in organized political parties."
Non-partisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations.
" In a direct democracy, one type of non-partisan democracy, any eligible person can be nominated."
" Although elections were used in ancient Athens, in Rome, and in the selection of popes and Holy Roman emperors, the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in Europe and North America beginning in the 17th century."
" In some systems no nominations take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting—with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement—in the jurisdiction."
" In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i."
"As far as partisan systems, in some countries, only members of a particular party can be nominated (see one-party state)."
"  Or, any eligible person can be nominated through a process; thus allowing him or her to be listed."
Electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems that convert the vote into a political decision.
" The first step is to tally the votes, for which various vote counting systems and ballot types are used."
 Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally.
 Most systems can be categorized as either proportional or majoritarian.
  Among the former are party-list proportional representation and additional member system.
  Among the latter are First Past the Post electoral system (relative majority) and absolute majority.
"  Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as approval voting, single transferable vote, instant runoff voting or a Condorcet method; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods."
"While openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter's ballot are usually an important exception."
"  The secret ballot is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation."
"When elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns."
"  Supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated, and frequently utilize campaign advertising."
 It is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via Political Forecasting methods.
The most expensive election campaign included US$7 billion spent on the 2012 United States presidential election and is followed by the US$5 billion spent on the 2014 Indian general election.
"The nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people, and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their mandate to continue in office."
 For that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals.
" In the United States, elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level, with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office."
" There is a variety of schedules, for example presidents: the President of Ireland is elected every seven years, the President of Russia and the President of Finland every six years, the President of France every five years, President of the United States every four years."
Pre-decided or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability.
" However, they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns, and make dissolving the legislature (parliamentary system) more problematic if the date should happen to fall at time when dissolution is inconvenient (e."
", the United Kingdom) only set maximum time in office, and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls."
" In practice, this means the government remains in power for close to its full term, and choose an election date it calculates to be in its best interests (unless something special happens, such as a motion of no-confidence)."
" This calculation depends on a number of variables, such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority."
"In many of the countries with weak rule of law, the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being ""free and fair"" is interference from the incumbent government."
" Dictators may use the powers of the executive (police, martial law, censorship, physical implementation of the election mechanism, etc."
) to remain in power despite popular opinion in favor of removal.
" Members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority (passing criminal laws, defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries) to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election."
"Non-governmental entities can also interfere with elections, through physical force, verbal intimidation, or fraud, which can result in improper casting or counting of votes."
 Monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections.
" Problems that prevent an election from being ""free and fair"" take various forms."
"=== Lack of open political debate or an informed electorate ===
"
"The electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of freedom of the press, lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control, and/or lack of access to news and political media."
" Freedom of speech may be curtailed by the state, favoring certain viewpoints or state propaganda."
"Gerrymandering, exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office, needlessly high restrictions on who may be a candidate, like ballot access rules, and manipulating thresholds for electoral success are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favor a specific faction or candidate."
"Those in power may arrest or assassinate candidates, suppress or even criminalize campaigning, close campaign headquarters, harass or beat campaign workers, or intimidate voters with violence."
" Foreign electoral intervention can also occur, with the United States interfering between 1946 and 2000 in 81 elections and Russia/USSR in 36."
"In 2018 the most intense interventions, by means of false information, were by China in Taiwan and by Russia in Latvia; the next highest levels were in Bahrain, Qatar and Hungary."
"violation of the secret ballot, ballot stuffing, tampering with voting machines,
"
"destruction of legitimately cast ballots,voter suppression, voter registration fraud, failure to validate voter residency, fraudulent tabulation of results, and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places."
" Other examples include persuading candidates not to run, such as through blackmailing, bribery, intimidation or physical violence."
"A sham election, or show election, is an election that is held purely for show; that is, without any significant political choice or real impact on results of election."
Sham elections are a common event in dictatorial regimes that feel the need to feign the appearance of public legitimacy.
" Published results usually show nearly 100% voter turnout and high support (typically at least 80%, and close to 100% in many cases) for the prescribed candidate(s) or for the referendum choice that favors the political party in power."
 Dictatorial regimes can also organize sham elections with results simulating those that might be achieved in democratic countries.
"Sometimes, only one government approved candidate is allowed to run in sham elections with no opposition candidates allowed, or opposition candidates are arrested on false charges (or even without any charges) before the election to prevent them from running."
"Ballots may contain only one ""yes"" option, or in the case of a simple ""yes or no"" question, security forces often persecute people who pick ""no"", thus encouraging them to pick the ""yes"" option."
" In other cases, those who vote receive stamps in their passport for doing so, while those who did not vote (and thus do not receive stamps) are persecuted as enemies of the people."
"In some cases, sham elections can backfire against the party in power, especially if the regime believes they are popular enough to win without coercion or fraud."
" The most famous example of this was the 1990 Myanmar general election, in which the government-sponsored National Unity Party suffered a landslide defeat to the opposition National League for Democracy and consequently the results were annulled."
"Examples of sham elections are the 1929 and 1934 elections in Fascist Italy, the 1942 general election in Imperial Japan, elections in Nazi Germany, the 1940 elections of the People's Parliaments in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the 1928, 1935, 1942, 1949, 1951 and 1958 elections in Portugal, the 1991 Kazakh presidential election, those in North Korea, and the 1995 and 2002 presidential referendums in Saddam Hussein's Iraq."
"In Mexico, all of the presidential elections from 1929 to 1982 are considered to be sham elections, as the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its predecessors governed the country in a de facto single-party system without serious opposition, and won all of the presidential elections in that period with percentages of votes well over 70%."
" The first actually competitive presidential election in modern Mexican history was that of 1988, in which for the first time the PRI candidate faced two strong opposition candidates, though the opposition would not win until 2000."
"A predetermined conclusion is always established by the regime through suppression of the opposition, coercion of voters, vote rigging, reporting a number of votes received greater than the number of voters, outright lying, or some combination of these."
" King of Liberia was reported to have won by 234,000 votes in the 1927 general election, a ""majority"" that was over fifteen times larger than the number of eligible voters."

" Each government has a kind of constitution, a statement of its governing principles and philosophy."
"While all types of organizations have governance, the term government is often used more specifically, to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments and subsidiary organizations."
"Historically prevalent forms of government include monarchy, aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, theocracy and tyranny."
" The main aspect of any philosophy of government is how political power is obtained, with the two main forms being electoral contest and hereditary succession."
"The word government derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb κυβερνάω [kubernáo] (meaning to steer with gubernaculum (rudder), the metaphorical sense being attested in Plato's Ship of State)."
"The Columbia Encyclopedia defines government as ""a system of social control under which the right to make laws, and the right to enforce them, is vested in a particular group in society""."
"While all types of organizations have governance, the word government is often used more specifically to refer to the approximately 200 independent national governments on Earth, as well as their subsidiary organizations."
"Finally, government is also sometimes used in English as a synonym for governance."
"The moment and place that the phenomenon of human government developed is lost in time; however, history does record the formations of early governments."
" About 5,000 years ago, the first small city-states appeared."
" By the third to second millenniums BC, some of these had developed into larger governed areas: Sumer, Ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization, and the Yellow River Civilization."
The development of agriculture and water control projects were a catalyst for the development of governments.
" On occasion a chief of a tribe was elected by various rituals or tests of strength to govern his tribe, sometimes with a group of elder tribesmen as a council."
" The human ability to precisely communicate abstract, learned information allowed humans to become ever more effective at agriculture, and that allowed for ever increasing population densities."
 David Christian explains how this resulted in states with laws and governments.
"As farming populations gathered in larger and denser communities, interactions between different groups increased and the social pressure rose until, in a striking parallel with star formation, new structures suddenly appeared, together with a new level of complexity."
" Like stars, cities and states reorganize and energize the smaller objects within their gravitational field."
"Starting at the end of the 17th century, the prevalence of republican forms of government grew."
" The Glorious Revolution in England, the American Revolution, and the French Revolution contributed to the growth of representative forms of government."
 The Soviet Union was the first large country to have a Communist government.
" Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, liberal democracy has become an even more prevalent form of government."
"In the nineteenth and twentieth century, there was a significant increase in the size and scale of government at the national level."
 This included the regulation of corporations and the development of the welfare state.
"In political science, it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of polities, as typologies of political systems are not obvious."
 It is especially important in the political science fields of comparative politics and international relations.
" Like all categories discerned within forms of government, the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined."
"Superficially, all governments have an official or ideal form."
" The United States is a constitutional republic, while the former Soviet Union was a socialist republic."
" However self-identification is not objective, and as Kopstein and Lichbach argue, defining regimes can be tricky."
" For example, Voltaire argued that ""the Holy Roman Empire is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire""."
Identifying a form of government is also difficult because many political systems originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by parties naming themselves after those movements; all with competing political-ideologies.
" Experience with those movements in power, and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government, can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves."
"Other complications include general non-consensus or deliberate ""distortion or bias"" of reasonable technical definitions to political ideologies and associated forms of governing, due to the nature of politics in the modern era."
" For example: The meaning of ""conservatism"" in the United States has little in common with the way the word's definition is used elsewhere."
" As Ribuffo notes, ""what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism""; a ""conservative"" in Finland would be labeled a ""socialist"" in the United States."
 Since the 1950s conservatism in the United States has been chiefly associated with the Republican Party.
" However, during the era of segregation many Southern Democrats were conservatives, and they played a key role in the Conservative Coalition that controlled Congress from 1937 to 1963."
Opinions vary by individuals concerning the types and properties of governments that exist.
" ""Shades of gray"" are commonplace in any government and its corresponding classification."
" Even the most liberal democracies limit rival political activity to one extent or another while the most tyrannical dictatorships must organize a broad base of support thereby creating difficulties for ""pigeonholing"" governments into narrow categories."
 Examples include the claims of the United States as being a plutocracy rather than a democracy since some American voters believe elections are being manipulated by wealthy Super PACs.
"The Classical Greek philosopher Plato discusses five types of regimes: aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy and tyranny."
 Plato also assigns a man to each of these regimes to illustrate what they stand for.
 These five regimes progressively degenerate starting with aristocracy at the top and tyranny at the bottom.
One method of classifying governments is through which people have the authority to rule.
"  This can either be one person (an autocracy, such as monarchy), a select group of people (an aristocracy), or the people as a whole (a democracy, such as a republic)."
"The difference of Commonwealths consisteth in the difference of the sovereign, or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude."
" And because the sovereignty is either in one man, or in an assembly of more than one; and into that assembly either every man hath right to enter, or not every one, but certain men distinguished from the rest; it is manifest there can be but three kinds of Commonwealth."
" For the representative must needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is the assembly of all, or but of a part."
" When the representative is one man, then is the Commonwealth a monarchy; when an assembly of all that will come together, then it is a democracy, or popular Commonwealth; when an assembly of a part only, then it is called an aristocracy."
" Other kind of Commonwealth there can be none: for either one, or more, or all, must have the sovereign power (which I have shown to be indivisible) entire."
"An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection)."
"Aristocracy (Greek ἀριστοκρατία aristokratía, from  ἄριστος aristos ""excellent"", and κράτος kratos ""power"") is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class."
"Many monarchies were aristocracies, although in modern constitutional monarchies the monarch himself or herself has little real power."
" The term aristocracy could also refer to the non-peasant, non-servant, and non-city classes in the feudal system."
Democracy is a system of government where the citizens exercise power by voting.
" In a direct democracy, the citizens as a whole form a governing body and vote directly on each issue."
 In a representative democracy the citizens elect representatives from among themselves.
" These representatives meet to form a governing body, such as a legislature."
" In a constitutional democracy the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy, but the constitution limits the majority and protects the minority, usually through the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights, e."
"A republic is a form of government in which the country is considered a ""public matter"" (Latin: res publica), not the private concern or property of the rulers, and where offices of states are subsequently directly or indirectly elected or appointed rather than inherited."
"  The people, or some significant portion of them, have supreme control over the government and where offices of state are elected or chosen by elected people."
 A common simplified definition of a republic is a government where the head of state is not a monarch.
" Montesquieu included both democracies, where all the people have a share in rule, and aristocracies or oligarchies, where only some of the people rule, as republican forms of government."
"Other terms used to describe different republics include democratic republic, parliamentary republic, semi-presidential republic, presidential republic, federal republic, and Islamic republic."
Federalism is a political concept in which a group of members are bound together by covenant with a governing representative head.
" The term ""federalism"" is also used to describe a system of government in which sovereignty is constitutionally divided between a central governing authority and constituent political units, variously called states, provinces or otherwise."
" Federalism is a system based upon democratic principles and institutions in which the power to govern is shared between national and provincial/state governments, creating what is often called a federation."
"Historically, most political systems originated as socioeconomic ideologies."
 Experience with those movements in power and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.
Certain major characteristics are defining of certain types; others are historically associated with certain types of government.
Rule according to higher law (unwritten ethical principles) vs.
" constitution or bill of rights with separation of powers and supermajority rules to prevent tyranny of the majority and protect minority rights

" gender quotas, gender equality provision, or silence on the matter

President is a common title for the head of state in most republics.
The functions exercised by a president vary according to the form of government.
" In parliamentary republics, they are usually, but not always, limited to those of the head of state and are thus largely ceremonial."
" Botswana and South Africa), and semi-presidential republics, the role of the president is more prominent, encompassing also (in most cases) the functions of the head of government."
" In authoritarian regimes, a dictator or leader of a one-party state may also be called a president."
" President"" and Madam President may apply to a person holding the title of president or presiding over certain other governmental bodies."
" President"" has subsequently been used by governments to refer to their heads of state."
 It is the conventional translation of non-English titles such as Monsieur le Président for the president of the French Republic.
 It also has a long history of usage as the title of the presiding officers of legislative and judicial bodies.
 The speaker of the House of Commons of Canada is addressed as président de la Chambre des communes in French and as Mr.
The 1787 Constitution of the United States did not specify the manner of address for the president.
" When George Washington was sworn in as the first president of the United States on April 30, 1789, the administering of the oath of office ended with the proclamation: ""Long live George Washington, President of the United States."
""" No title other than the name of the office of the executive was officially used at the inauguration."
" The question of a presidential title was being debated in Congress at the time, however, having become official legislative business with Richard Henry Lee's motion of April 23, 1789."
" Lee's motion asked congress to consider ""what titles it will be proper to annex to the offices of President and Vice President of the United States – if any other than those given in the Constitution""."
" Vice President John Adams, in his role as President of the United States Senate, organized a congressional committee."
 There Adams agitated for the adoption of the style of Highness (as well as the title of Protector of Their [the United States'] Liberties) for the President.
 Adams and Lee were among the most outspoken proponents of an exalted presidential title.
"Others favored the variant of Electoral Highness or the lesser Excellency, the latter of which was vociferously opposed by Adams, who contended that it was far beneath the presidential dignity, as the executives of the states, some of which were also titled ""President"" (e."
" the President of Pennsylvania), at that time often enjoyed the style of Excellency; Adams said the president ""would be leveled with colonial governors or with functionaries from German princedoms"" if he were to use the style of Excellency."
" Adams and Richard Henry Lee both feared that cabals of powerful senators would unduly influence a weak executive, and saw an exalted title as a way of strengthening the presidency."
" On further consideration, Adams deemed even Highness insufficient and instead proposed that the executive, both the president and the vice president (i."
", himself), be styled Majesty to prevent the ""great danger"" of an executive with insufficient dignity."
" Adams' efforts were met with widespread derision and perplexion; Thomas Jefferson called them ""the most superlatively ridiculous thing I ever heard of"", while Benjamin Franklin considered it ""absolutely mad""."
"Washington consented to the demands of James Madison and the United States House of Representatives that the title be altered to ""Mr."
" Nonetheless, later ""The Honorable"" became the standard title of the President in formal address, and ""His/Her Excellency"" became the title of the President when addressed formally internationally."
"Historically, the title was reserved for the incumbent president only, and was not to be used for former presidents, holding that it was not proper to use the title as a courtesy title when addressing a former president."
" According to the official website of the United States of America, the correct way to address a letter is to use ""The Honorable John Doe"" and the correct salutation is ""Mr Doe""."
" President"", both formally and informally, and some contemporary experts on etiquette maintain that it is entirely appropriate."
" President"" is used in a number of formal instances as well: for example anyone presiding over the United States Senate is addressed as ""Mr."
"/Madame President"", especially the Vice President, who is the President of the Senate."
" Other uses of the title include presidents of state and local legislatures, however only the president of the United States uses the title outside of formal sessions."
"Thomas Hungerford, who became the first speaker of the English House of Commons in 1376, used the title, ""Mr."
" Speaker"", a precedent followed by subsequent speakers of the House of Commons."
"By the 18th century, the president of a French parlement was addressed as ""Monsieur le Président""."
" In Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's 1782 novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses (""Dangerous Liaisons""), the wife of a magistrate in a parlement is referred to as Madame la Présidente de Tourvel (""Madam President of Tourvel"")."
" When the Second French Republic was established in 1848, ""Monsieur le Président"" became the title of the president of the French Republic."
"The speaker of the House of Commons of Canada, established in 1867, is also addressed as ""Monsieur le Président"" or ""Madame la Présidente"" in French."
"The title president is derived from the Latin prae- ""before"" + sedere ""to sit""."
" As such, it originally designated the officer who presides over or ""sits before"" a gathering and ensures that debate is conducted according to the rules of order (see also chairman and speaker), but today it most commonly refers to an executive official in any social organization."
 Early examples are from the universities of Oxford and Cambridge (from 1464) and the founding president of the Royal Society William Brouncker in 1660.
" This usage survives today in the title of such offices as ""President of the Board of Trade"" and ""Lord President of the Council"" in the United Kingdom, as well as ""President of the Senate"" in the United States (one of the roles constitutionally assigned to the vice president)."
" The officiating priest at certain Anglican religious services, too, is sometimes called the ""president"" in this sense."
" However, the most common modern usage is as the title of a head of state in a republic."
"In pre-revolutionary France, the president of a Parlement evolved into a powerful magistrate, a member of the so-called noblesse de robe (""nobility of the gown""), with considerable judicial as well as administrative authority."
 The name referred to his primary role of presiding over trials and other hearings.
" In the 17th and 18th centuries, seats in the Parlements, including presidencies, became effectively hereditary, since the holder of the office could ensure that it would pass to an heir by paying the crown a special tax known as the paulette."
" The post of ""first president"" (premier président), however, could be held by only the King's nominees."
 In modern France the chief judge of a court is known as its president (président de la cour).
"The word ""presidents"" is also used in the King James Bible at Daniel 6:2 to translate the Aramaic term סָרְכִ֣ין (sā·rə·ḵîn), a word of likely Persian origin, meaning ""officials"", ""commissioners"", ""overseers"" or ""chiefs""."
The first usage of the word president to denote the highest official in a government was during the Commonwealth of England.
" After the abolition of the monarchy the English Council of State, whose members were elected by the House of Commons, became the executive government of the Commonwealth."
" The Council of State was the successor of the Privy Council, which had previously been headed by the lord president; its successor the Council of State was also headed by a lord president, the first of which was John Bradshaw."
" However, the lord president alone was not head of state, because that office was vested in the council as a whole."
"The modern usage of the term president to designate a single person who is the head of state of a republic can be traced directly to the United States Constitution of 1787, which created the office of President of the United States."
" Previous American governments had included ""presidents"" (such as the president of the Continental Congress or the president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress), but these were presiding officers in the older sense, with no executive authority."
" It has been suggested that the executive use of the term was borrowed from early American colleges and universities, which were usually headed by a president."
" British universities were headed by an official called the ""Chancellor"" (typically a ceremonial position) while the chief administrator held the title of ""Vice-Chancellor""."
 But America's first institutions of higher learning (such as Harvard University and Yale University) didn't resemble a full-sized university so much as one of its constituent colleges.
" A number of colleges at Cambridge University featured an official called the ""president""."
" The head, for instance, of Magdalene College, Cambridge was called the master and his second the president."
" The first president of Harvard, Henry Dunster, had been educated at Magdalene."
" Some have speculated that he borrowed the term out of a sense of humility, considering himself only a temporary place-holder."
" The presiding official of Yale College, originally a ""rector"" (after the usage of continental European universities), became ""president"" in 1745."
" President"", is borrowed from British Parliamentary tradition, in which the presiding Speaker of the House of Commons is referred to as ""Mr/Mrs."
" Coincidentally, this usage resembles the older French custom of referring to the president of a parlement as ""Monsieur/Madame le Président"", a form of address that in modern France applies to both the president of the Republic and to chief judges."
" Similarly, the Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada is addressed by francophone parliamentarians as ""Monsieur/Madame le/la Président(e)""."
" In Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's novel Les Liaisons Dangereuses of 1782, the character identified as Madame la Présidente de Tourvel (""Madam President of Tourvel"") is the wife of a magistrate in a parlement."
" The fictional name Tourvel refers not to the parlement in which the magistrate sits, but rather, in imitation of an aristocratic title, to his private estate."
"Once the United States adopted the title of ""president"" for its republican head of state, many other nations followed suit."
 Haiti became the first presidential republic in Latin America when Henri Christophe assumed the title in 1807.
 Almost all the American nations that became independent from Spain in the early 1810s and 1820s chose a US-style president as their chief executive.
" The first European president was the president of the Italian Republic of 1802, a client state of revolutionary France, in the person of Napoleon Bonaparte."
" The first African president was the president of Liberia (1848), while the first Asian president was the president of the Republic of China (1912)."
"In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the powers of presidencies have varied from country to country."
 The spectrum of power has included presidents-for-life and hereditary presidencies to ceremonial heads of state.
"Presidents in the countries with a democratic or representative form of government are usually elected for a specified period of time and in some cases may be re-elected by the same process by which they are appointed, i."
" Some presidencies, such as that of Ireland, are largely ceremonial, whereas other systems vest the president with substantive powers such as the appointment and dismissal of prime ministers or cabinets, the power to declare war, and powers of veto on legislation."
" In many nations the president is also the commander-in-chief of the nation's armed forces, though once again this can range from a ceremonial role to one with considerable authority."
"In almost all states with a presidential system of government, the president exercises the functions of head of state and head of government, i."
" When a president is not only head of state, but also head of government, this is known in Europe as a President of Counsel (from the French Présidente du Conseil), used 1871–1940 and 1944–1958 in the Third and Fourth French Republics."
 In the United States the president has always been both Head of State and Head of Government and has always had the title of President.
Presidents in this system are either directly elected by popular vote or indirectly elected by an electoral college or some other democratically elected body.
"In the United States, the president is indirectly elected by the Electoral College made up of electors chosen by voters in the presidential election."
" In most states of the United States, each elector is committed to voting for a specified candidate determined by the popular vote in each state, so that the people, in voting for each elector, are in effect voting for the candidate."
" However, for various reasons the numbers of electors in favour of each candidate are unlikely to be proportional to the popular vote."
" Thus, in five close United States elections (1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016), the candidate with the most popular votes still lost the election."
"In Mexico, the president is directly elected for a six-year term by popular vote."
 The candidate who wins the most votes is elected president even without an absolute majority.
" The 2006 Mexican elections had a fierce competition, the electoral results showed a minimal difference between the two most voted candidates and such difference was just about the 0."
 The Federal Electoral Tribunal declared an elected president after a controversial post-electoral process.
"In Brazil, the president is directly elected for a four-year term by popular vote."
" If no candidates achieve a majority of the votes, there is a runoff election between the two candidates with most votes."
" Again, a candidate needs a majority of the vote to be elected."
" In Brazil, a president cannot be elected to more than two consecutive terms, but there is no limit on the number of terms a president can serve."
"Many South American, Central American, African and some Asian nations follow the presidential model."
"A second system is the semi-presidential system, also known as the French model."
" In this system, as in the parliamentary system, there are both a president and a prime minister; but unlike the parliamentary system, the president may have significant day-to-day power."
" For example, in France, when their party controls the majority of seats in the National Assembly, the president can operate closely with the parliament and prime minister, and work towards a common agenda."
" When the National Assembly is controlled by their opponents, however, the president can find themselves marginalized with the opposition party prime minister exercising most of the power."
" Though the prime minister remains an appointee of the president, the president must obey the rules of parliament, and select a leader from the house's majority holding party."
" Thus, sometimes the president and prime minister can be allies, sometimes rivals; the latter situation is known in France as cohabitation."
" Variants of the French semi-presidential system, developed at the beginning of the Fifth Republic by Charles de Gaulle, are used in France, Portugal, Romania, Sri Lanka and several post-colonial countries which have emulated the French model."
" In Finland, although the 2000 constitution moved towards a ceremonial presidency, the system is still formally semi-presidential, with the president of Finland retaining e."
"The parliamentary republic, is a parliamentary system in which the presidency is largely ceremonial with either de facto or no significant executive authority (such as the president of Austria) or de jure no significant executive power (such as the president of Ireland), and the executive powers rests with the prime minister who automatically assumes the post as head of a majority party or coalition, but takes oath of office administered by the president."
" However, the president is head of the civil service, commander in chief of the armed forces and in some cases can dissolve parliament."
" Countries using this system include Austria, Armenia, Albania, Bangladesh, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Malta, Pakistan, and Singapore."
"A variation of the parliamentary republic is a system with an executive president in which the president is the head of state and the government but unlike a presidential system, is elected by and accountable to a parliament, and referred to as president."
" Countries using this system include Botswana, Nauru and South Africa."
"In dictatorships, the title of president is frequently taken by self-appointed or military-backed leaders."
" Such is the case in many states: Idi Amin in Uganda, Mobutu Sese Seko in Zaire, Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines, Suharto in Indonesia, and Saddam Hussein in Iraq are some examples."
" Other presidents in authoritarian states have wielded only symbolic or no power such as Craveiro Lopes in Portugal and Joaquín Balaguer under the ""Trujillo Era"" of the Dominican Republic."
President for Life is a title assumed by some dictators to try to ensure their authority or legitimacy is never questioned.
" Ironically, most leaders who proclaim themselves president for life do not in fact successfully serve a life term."
" On the other hand, presidents like Alexandre Pétion, Rafael Carrera, Josip Broz Tito and François Duvalier died in office."
 Kim Il-sung was named Eternal President of the Republic after his death.
Only a tiny minority of modern republics do not have a single head of state.
"Switzerland, where the headship of state is collectively vested in the seven-member Swiss Federal Council, although there is also a president of the Confederation, who is a member of the Federal Council elected by the Federal Assembly (the Swiss parliament) for a year (constitutional convention mandates that the post rotates every New Year's Day)."
The Captains Regent of San Marino elected by the Grand and General Council.
"In the former Soviet Union from 1922 until 1938 there existed an office of collective head of state known as the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union that consisted of four and later seven chairmen representing the central executive committees of all union republics from Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Trans-Caucasusia and from 1925 Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan."
" From 1927 until 1989 however, real power was exercised by the General Secretary of the Soviet Communist Party."
" After 1938, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet executed powers of a collective head of state, and its chairman was often called ""president"" in the West, though a singular head of state named ""president"" was later established in 1990."
"Yugoslavia after the death of Josip Broz Tito, where a presidency consisting of members from each federal unit ruled the country until its breakup."
"Ukraine, in 1918–1920 there existed Directorate composed of seven leaders of parliamentary factions and served as a collective head of state."
"The three-member Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina contains a member from each of the country's largest ethnic groups and serves as the collective head of state of Bosnia and Herzegovina

The President of China is the head of state of the People's Republic of China.
" Under the country's constitution, the presidency is a largely ceremonial office with limited power."
" However, since 1993, as a matter of convention, the presidency has been held simultaneously by the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, the top leader in the single-party system."
"Between 1982 and 2018, the constitution stipulated that the president could not serve more than two consecutive terms."
" During the Mao era and also since 2018, there were no term limits attached to this office."
" In 2018, the term limits of the presidency were abolished, but its powers and ceremonial role were unchanged."
"As the country's head of state, in most countries the president is entitled to certain perquisites, and may have a prestigious residence, often a lavish mansion or palace, sometimes more than one (e."
" summer and winter residences, or a country retreat) Customary symbols of office may include an official uniform, decorations, a presidential seal, coat of arms, flag and other visible accessories, as well as military honours such as gun salutes, ruffles and flourishes, and a presidential guard."
 A common presidential symbol is the presidential sash worn most often by presidents in Latin America and Africa as a symbol of the continuity of the office.
"United Nations member countries in columns, other entities at the beginning:
"
"Some countries with parliamentary systems use a term meaning/translating as ""president"" (in some languages indistinguishable from chairman) for the head of parliamentary government, often as President of the Government, President of the Council of Ministers or President of the Executive Council."
"However, such an official is explicitly not the president of the country."
" Rather, he/she is called a president in an older sense of the word, to denote the fact that he/she heads the cabinet."
 A separate head of state generally exists in their country who instead serves as the president or monarch of the country.
"Thus, such officials are really premiers, and to avoid confusion are often described simply as 'prime minister' when being mentioned internationally."
"The Prime Minister of Spain is officially referred to as the president of the Government of Spain, and informally known as the ""president""."
"The official title of the Italian Prime Minister is President of the Council of Ministers (Italian Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri)
"
"Under the French Third and the Fourth Republics, the ""President of the Council"" (of ministers – a prime minister) was the head of government, with the President of the Republic a largely symbolic figurehead."
"From 1963 until 1992, the head of government of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was the President of the Federal Executive Council after the 1963 Constitution abolished the office of Prime Minister of Yugoslavia and transferred its functions to the President of the Federal Executive Council."
" Despite this, foreign media sources continued to refer to individuals holding the office of President of the Federal Executive Council as being the ""Prime Minister of Yugoslavia""."
The Prime minister of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1937 was titled President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State.
" At the same time, the Irish Free State was a constitutional monarchy with a reigning monarch, the King of Ireland, as well as a resident Governor-General carrying out many head of state functions."
"Under the constitutional monarchies of Brazil and Portugal, the president of the Council of Ministers (Portuguese Presidente do Conselho de Ministros) was the head of government, with the Monarch being the head of State."
" Under the Portuguese First and Second Republics, the head of government was the president of the Ministry (Portuguese Presidente do Ministério) and then the president of the Council of Ministers, with the president of the Republic as the head of State."
The official title of the Croatian prime minister is President of the Government of the Republic of Croatia (Croatian: Predsjednik Vlade Republike Hrvatske).
The official title of the Polish prime minister is President of the Council of Ministers (Polish Prezes Rady Ministrów).
"In British constitutional practice, the chairman of an Executive Council, acting in such a capacity, is known as a president of the Executive Council."
 Usually this person is the Governor and it always stays like that.
"Between 1918 and 1934, Estonia had no separate head of state."
" Both prime ministers (1918–1920) and state elders (1920–1934) often translated as ""presidents"") were elected by the parliament."
"President can also be the title of the chief executive at a lower administrative level, such as the parish presidents of the parishes of the U."
" state of Louisiana, the presiding member of city council for villages in the U."
" state of Illinois, or the municipal presidents of Mexico's municipalities."
 Perhaps the best known sub-national presidents are the borough presidents of the five boroughs of New York City.
"In Poland the President of the City (Polish: Prezydent miasta) is the executive authority of the municipality elected in direct elections, the equivalent of the mayor."
 The Office of the President (Mayor) is also found in Germany and Switzerland.
"Governors of ethnic republics in the Russian Federation used to have the title of President, occasionally alongside other, secondary titles such as Chairman of the Government (also used by Prime Minister of Russia)."
" This likely reflects the origin of Russian republics as homelands for various ethnic groups: while all federal subjects of Russia are currently de jure equal, their predecessors, the ASSRs, used to enjoy more privileges than the ordinary krais and oblasts of the RSFSR (such as greater representation in the Soviet of Nationalities)."
" Thus, the ASSRs and their eventual successors would have more in common with nation-states than with ordinary administrative divisions, at least in spirit, and would choose titles accordingly."
"Over the course of the 2010s the presidents of Russian republics would progressively change their title to that of Head (Russian: глава), a proposition suggested by the president of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov and later made law by the Parliament of Russia and President Dmitriy Medvedev in 2010."
" Despite this, however, presidents of Tatarstan would reject this change and, as of 2017, retain their title in defiance of Russian law."
 The new title did not result in any changes in the powers wielded by the governors.
"The lord president of the Council is one of the Great Officers of State in the United Kingdom who presides over meetings of British Privy Council; the Cabinet headed by the prime minister is technically a committee of the Council, and all decisions of the Cabinet are formally approved through Orders in Council."
" Although the lord president is a member of the Cabinet, the position is largely a ceremonial one and is traditionally given to either the leader of the House of Commons or the leader of the House of Lords."
Historically the president of the Board of Trade was a cabinet member.
"In Alderney, the elected head of government is called the president of the States of Alderney."
"In Spain, the executive leaders of the autonomous communities (regions) are called presidents."
" In each community, they can be called Presidente de la Comunidad or Presidente del Consejo among others."
 They are elected by their respective regional assemblies and have similar powers to a state president or governor.
"Below a president, there can be a number of or ""vice presidents"" (or occasionally ""deputy presidents"") and sometimes several ""assistant presidents"" or ""assistant vice presidents"", depending on the organisation and its size."
 These posts do not hold the same power but more of a subordinate position to the president.
" However, power can be transferred in special circumstances to the deputy or vice president."
 Normally vice presidents hold some power and special responsibilities below that of the president.
" The difference between vice/deputy presidents and assistant/associate vice presidents is the former are legally allowed to run an organisation, exercising the same powers (as well as being second in command) whereas the latter are not."
"In some countries the speaker of their unicameral legislatures, or of one or both houses of bicameral legislatures, the speakers have the title of president of ""the body"", as in the case of Spain, where the Speaker of the Congress is the president of the Congress of Deputies and the Speaker of the Senate is the president of the Senate."
"In French legal terminology, the president of a court consisting of multiple judges is the foremost judge; he chairs the meeting of the court and directs the debates (and is thus addressed as ""Mrs President"", ""Madame la Présidente"", ""Mr President"", or Monsieur le Président."
" In general, a court comprises several chambers, each with its own president; thus the most senior of these is called the ""first president"" (as in: ""the First President of the Court of Cassation is the most senior judge in France"")."
 Similarly in English legal practice the most senior judge in each division uses this title (e.
" President of the Family Division, President of the Court of Appeal)."
"In the Spanish Judiciary, the leader of a court of multiples judges is called President of the Court."
" The same happens with the different bodies of the Spanish judicial system, where we can find a president of the Supreme Court, a president of the National Court and presidents in the Regional High Courts of Justice and in the Provincial Courts."
" The body that rules over the Judiciary in Spain is the General Council of the Judiciary, and its president is the president of the Supreme Court, which is normally called President of the Supreme Court and of the GCJ."
"The Constitutional Court is not part of the Judiciary, but the leader of it is called President of the Constitutional Court."
"In the recently established Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the most senior judge is called the president of the Supreme Court."
" The lady/lord president of the Court of Session is head of the judiciary in Scotland, and presiding judge (and Senator) of the College of Justice and Court of Session, as well as being Lady/Lord Justice General of Scotland and head of the High Court of Justiciary, the offices having been combined in 1784."
"Titles for a president's spouse, if female, have ranged from ""Marquise"" to ""Lady"" to simply ""Mrs."
" If male the title of the president's spouse may be ""Marquis"", ""Lord"", or merely ""Mr."
"President George Washington's wife, Martha Washington, was often called ""Lady Washington""."
" By the 1850s in the United States, the term ""lady"" had changed from a title of nobility to a term of address for a respected and well-mannered woman."
" The use of ""First Lady"" to refer to the wife of the president of the United States was popularized about the time of the US Civil War."
" Dolley Madison, the wife of President James Madison, was remembered after her death in 1849 by President Zachary Taylor as ""truly our First Lady for a half a century""."
"On 8 November 2016, the night of the 2016 presidential election in the United States, images of leaked pre-printed copies of Newsweek magazine showed the magazine celebrating the win of the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, with the cover titled ""Madam President""."
" It is common for Newsweek to prepare for the eventuality of either candidate winning, though it was unusual that it was both published and distributed; the cover was pulled from newsstands after it became clear that Donald Trump had secured a majority of electoral votes, winning the election."
Policy is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes.
" A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol."
 Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within an organization.
 Policies can assist in both subjective and objective decision making.
" Policies used in subjective decision making usually assist senior management with decisions that must be based on the relative merits of a number of factors, and as a result are often hard to test objectively, e."
" In contrast, policies to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in nature and can be objectively tested, e."
"The term may apply to government, public sector organizations and groups, as well as individuals, Presidential executive orders, corporate privacy policies, and parliamentary rules of order are all examples of policy."
" a law requiring the payment of taxes on income), policy merely guides actions toward those that are most likely to achieve a desired outcome."
"Policy or policy study may also refer to the process of making important organizational decisions, including the identification of different alternatives such as programs or spending priorities, and choosing among them on the basis of the impact they will have."
" Policies can be understood as political, managerial, financial, and administrative mechanisms arranged to reach explicit goals."
" In public corporate finance, a critical accounting policy is a policy for a firm/company or an industry that is considered to have a notably high subjective element, and that has a material impact on the financial statements."
The intended effects of a policy vary widely according to the organization and the context in which they are made.
" Broadly, policies are typically instituted to avoid some negative effect that has been noticed in the 
"
Corporate purchasing policies provide an example of how organizations attempt to avoid negative  effects.
 Many large companies have policies that all purchases above a certain value must be performed through a purchasing process.
" By requiring this standard purchasing process through policy, the organization can limit waste and standardize the way purchasing is done."
The State of California provides an example of benefit-seeking policy.
" In recent years, the numbers of hybrid cars in California has increased dramatically, in part because of policy changes in Federal law that provided USD $1,500 in tax credits (since phased out) as well as the use of high-occupancy vehicle lanes to hybrid owners (no loew hybrid vehicles)."
" In this case, the organization (state and/or federal government) created an effect (increased ownership and use of hybrid vehicles) through policy (tax breaks, highway lanes)."
Policies frequently have side effects or unintended consequences.
  Because the environments that policies seek to influence or manipulate are typically complex adaptive systems (e.
" governments, societies, large companies), making a policy change can have counterintuitive results."
"  For example, a government may make a policy decision to raise taxes, in hopes of increasing overall tax revenue."
"  Depending on the size of the tax increase, this may have the overall effect of reducing tax revenue by causing capital flight or by creating a rate so high that citizens are deterred from earning the money that is taxed."
")The policy formulation process theoretically includes an attempt to assess as many areas of potential policy impact as possible, to lessen the chances that a given policy will have unexpected or unintended consequences."
"In political science, the policy cycle is a tool used for analyzing the development of a policy item."
" It can also be referred to as a ""stagist approach"", ""stages heuristic"" or ""stages approach""."
" It is thus a rule of thumb rather than the actual reality of how policy is created, but has been influential in how political scientists looked at policy in general."
"Harold Lasswell's popular model of the policy cycle divided the process into seven distinct stages, asking questions of both how and why public policies should be made."
"  With the stages ranging from (1) intelligence, (2) promotion, (3) prescription, (4) invocation, (5) application, (6) termination and (7) appraisal, this process inherently attempts to combine policy implementation to formulated policy goals."
" Anderson, in his Public Policy-Making (1974) has the following stages:
"
Agenda setting (Problem identification) – The recognition of certain subject as a problem demanding further government attention.
Policy formulation – Involves exploring a variation of options or alternative courses of action available for addressing the problem.
"Decision-making – Government decides on an ultimate course of action, whether to perpetuate the policy status quo or alter it."
" (Decision could be 'positive', 'negative', or 'no-action')
"
Implementation – The ultimate decision made earlier will be put into practice.
Evaluation – Assesses the effectiveness of a public policy in terms of its perceived intentions and results.
 Policy actors attempt to determine whether the course of action is a success or failure by examining its impact and outcomes.
"An eight step policy cycle is developed in detail in The Australian Policy Handbook by Peter Bridgman and Glyn Davis: (now with Catherine Althaus in its 4th and 5th editions)
"
"Policy EvaluationThe Althaus, Bridgman & Davis model is heuristic and iterative."
 It is intentionally normative and not meant to be diagnostic or predictive.
" Policy cycles are typically characterized as adopting a classical approach, and tend to describe processes from the perspective of policy decision makers."
" Accordingly, some postpositivist academics challenge cyclical models as unresponsive and unrealistic, preferring systemic and more complex models."
" They consider a broader range of actors involved in the policy space that includes civil society organisations, the media, intellectuals, think tanks or policy research institutes, corporations, lobbyists, etc."
Policies are typically promulgated through official written documents.
 Policy documents often come with the endorsement or signature of the executive powers within an organization to legitimize the policy and demonstrate that it is considered in force.
 Such documents often have standard formats that are particular to the organization issuing the policy.
"  While such formats differ in form, policy documents usually contain certain standard components including:
"
"A purpose statement, outlining why the organization is issuing the policy, and what its desired effect or outcome of the policy should be."
"An applicability and scope statement, describing who the policy affects and which actions are impacted by the policy."
" The applicability and scope may expressly exclude certain people, organizations, or actions from the policy requirements."
"  Applicability and scope is used to focus the policy on only the desired targets, and avoid unintended consequences where possible."
An effective date which indicates when the policy comes into force.
"A responsibilities section, indicating which parties and organizations are responsible for carrying out individual policy statements."
  Many policies may require the establishment of some ongoing function or action.
"  For example, a purchasing policy might specify that a purchasing office be created to process purchase requests, and that this office would be responsible for ongoing actions."
  Responsibilities often include identification of any relevant oversight and/or governance structures.
"Policy statements indicating the specific regulations, requirements, or modifications to organizational behavior that the policy is creating."
"  Policy statements are extremely diverse depending on the organization and intent, and may take almost any form."
"Background, indicating any reasons, history, ethical background statements, and/or intent that led to the creation of the policy, which may be listed as motivating factors."
"  This information is often quite valuable when policies must be evaluated or used in ambiguous situations, just as the intent of a law can be useful to a court when deciding a case that involves that law."
"Definitions, providing clear and unambiguous definitions for terms and concepts found in the policy document."
" Lowi proposed four types of policy, namely distributive, redistributive, regulatory and constituent in his article ""Four Systems of Policy, Politics and Choice"" and in ""American Business, Public Policy, Case Studies and Political Theory""."
" Policy addresses the intent of the organization, whether government, business, professional, or voluntary."
" Policy is intended to affect the ""real"" world, by guiding the decisions that are made."
" Whether they are formally written or not, most organizations have identified policies."
 The following is a sample of several different types of policies broken down by their effect on members of the organization.
"Distributive policies extend goods and services to members of an organization, as well as distributing the costs of the goods/services amongst the members of the organization."
" Examples include government policies that impact spending for welfare, public education, highways, and public safety, or a professional organization's benefits plan."
"Regulatory policies, or mandates, limit the discretion of individuals and agencies, or otherwise compel certain types of behavior."
 These policies are generally thought to be best applied when good behavior can be easily defined and bad behavior can be easily regulated and punished through fines or sanctions.
 An example of a fairly successful public regulatory policy is that of a highway speed limit.
"Constituent policies create executive power entities, or deal with laws."
 Constituent policies also deal with fiscal policy in some circumstances.
Policies are dynamic; they are not just static lists of goals or laws.
" Policy blueprints have to be implemented, often with unexpected results."
" Social policies are what happens 'on the ground' when they are implemented, as well as what happens at the decision making or legislative stage."
"Official government policy (legislation or guidelines that govern how laws should be put into operation)
"
"Broad ideas and goals in political manifestos and pamphlets
"
"  For example, the equal opportunity policy of a company shows that the company aims to treat all its staff equally."
The actions the organization actually takes may often vary significantly from stated policy.
" This difference is sometimes caused by political compromise over policy, while in other situations it is caused by lack of policy implementation and enforcement."
" Implementing policy may have unexpected results, stemming from a policy whose reach extends further than the problem it was originally crafted to address."
" Additionally, unpredictable results may arise from selective or idiosyncratic enforcement of policy."
" non-stationary)These qualifiers can be combined, so one could, for example, have a stationary-memoryless-index policy."
"In enterprise architecture for systems design, policy appliances are technical control and logging mechanisms to enforce or reconcile policy (systems use) rules and to ensure accountability in information systems."
"In insurance, policies are contracts between insurer and insured used to indemnify (protect) against potential loss from specified perils."
" While these documents are referred to as policies, they are in actuality a form of contract – see insurance contract."
"In gambling, policy is a form of an unsanctioned lottery, where players purport to purchase insurance against a chosen number being picked by a legitimate lottery."
"In artificial intelligence planning  and reinforcement learning, a policy prescribes a non-empty deliberation (sequence of actions) given a non-empty sequence of states."
"In debate, the term ""policy"" is slang for policy or cross-examination debate."

" ""Women as policy makers and donors: female legislators and foreign aid""."
"A republic (Latin: res publica, meaning ""public affair"") is a form of government in which ""power is held by the people and their elected representatives""."
" In republics, the country is considered a ""public matter"", not the private concern or property of the rulers."
 The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group.
" With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state."
"As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word ""republic"" as part of their official names – not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word ""republic"" used in the names of all states with elected governments."
"The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means ""public thing"", ""public matter"", or ""public affair"" and was used to refer to the state as a whole."
" The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC."
" This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority."
"Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as republican in nature."
" For instance, Article IV of the United States Constitution ""guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government""."
" Another example is the Soviet Union which described itself as being a federation of ""Soviet Socialist Republics"", in reference to the 15 individually federal, multinational, top-level subdivisions or republics."
 The Russian Federation is a state that is composed partly of several republics.
The term originates from the Latin translation of Greek word politeia.
" Cicero, among other Latin writers, translated politeia as res publica and it was in turn translated by Renaissance scholars as ""republic"" (or similar terms in various western European languages)."
"The term politeia can be translated as form of government, polity, or regime and is therefore not always a word for a specific type of regime as the modern word republic is."
 One of Plato's major works on political science was titled Politeia and in English it is thus known as The Republic.
" However, apart from the title, in modern translations of The Republic, alternative translations of politeia are also used."
"However, in Book III of his Politics, Aristotle was apparently the first classical writer to state that the term politeia can be used to refer more specifically to one type of politeia: ""When the citizens at large govern for the public good, it is called by the name common to all governments (to koinon onoma pasōn tōn politeiōn), government (politeia)""."
" Also amongst classical Latin, the term ""republic"" can be used in a general way to refer to any regime, or in a specific way to refer to governments which work for the public good."
"In medieval Northern Italy, a number of city states had commune or signoria based governments."
" In the late Middle Ages, writers such as Giovanni Villani began writing about the nature of these states and the differences from other types of regime."
" They used terms such as libertas populi, a free people, to describe the states."
 The terminology changed in the 15th century as the renewed interest in the writings of Ancient Rome caused writers to prefer using classical terminology.
" To describe non-monarchical states writers, most importantly Leonardo Bruni, adopted the Latin phrase res publica."
"While Bruni and Machiavelli used the term to describe the states of Northern Italy, which were not monarchies, the term res publica has a set of interrelated meanings in the original Latin."
" The term can quite literally be translated as ""public matter""."
" It was most often used by Roman writers to refer to the state and government, even during the period of the Roman Empire."
"In subsequent centuries, the English word ""commonwealth"" came to be used as a translation of res publica, and its use in English was comparable to how the Romans used the term res publica."
" Notably, during The Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell the word commonwealth was the most common term to call the new monarchless state, but the word republic was also in common use."
" Likewise, in Polish the term was translated as rzeczpospolita, although the translation is now only used with respect to Poland."
"Presently, the term ""republic"" commonly means a system of government which derives its power from the people rather than from another basis, such as heredity or divine right."
"While the philosophical terminology developed in classical Greece and Rome, as already noted by Aristotle there was already a long history of city states with a wide variety of constitutions, not only in Greece but also in the Middle East."
" After the classical period, during the Middle Ages, many free cities developed again, such as Venice."
"The modern type of ""republic"" itself is different from any type of state found in the classical world."
" Nevertheless, there are a number of states of the classical era that are today still called republics."
" While the structure and governance of these states was different from that of any modern republic, there is debate about the extent to which classical, medieval, and modern republics form a historical continuum."
 Pocock has argued that a distinct republican tradition stretches from the classical world to the present.
" Paul Rahe, for instance, argues that the classical republics had a form of government with few links to those in any modern country."
The political philosophy of the classical republics has in any case had an influence on republican thought throughout the subsequent centuries.
" Philosophers and politicians advocating republics, such as Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Adams, and Madison, relied heavily on classical Greek and Roman sources which described various types of regimes."
" One form Aristotle named politeia, which consisted of a mixture of the other forms."
 He argued that this was one of the ideal forms of government.
" Polybius expanded on many of these ideas, again focusing on the idea of mixed government."
 The most important Roman work in this tradition is Cicero's De re publica.
"Over time, the classical republics were either conquered by empires or became ones themselves."
 Most of the Greek republics were annexed to the Macedonian Empire of Alexander.
" The Roman Republic expanded dramatically conquering the other states of the Mediterranean that could be considered republics, such as Carthage."
"The term ""republic"" is not commonly used to refer to pre-classical city-states, especially if outside Europe and the area which was under Graeco-Roman influence."
 However some early states outside Europe had governments that are sometimes today considered similar to republics.
"In the ancient Near East, a number of cities of the Eastern Mediterranean achieved collective rule."
 Republic city-states flourished in Phoenicia along the Levantine coast starting from the 11th century BC.
" In ancient Phoenicia, the concept of Shophet, very similar to a Roman consul, came to be; both served for a year in pair of two."
" Under Persian rule (539–332 BCE), Phoenician city-states such as Tyre abolished the king system and adopted ""a system of the suffetes (judges), who remained in power for short mandates of 6 years""."
" Arwad has been cited as one of the earliest known examples of a republic, in which the people, rather than a monarch, are described as sovereign."
before the United Monarchy has also been considered a type of republic.
 In Africa the Axum Empire was organized as a confederation ruled similarly to a royal republic.
"Early republican institutions comes from the independent Gaṇa sanghas - gana means ""tribe"" and sangha means ""assembly"" - which may have existed as early as the 6th century BC and persisted in some areas until the 4th century in India."
" The evidence for this is scattered, however, and no pure historical source exists for that period."
" Diodorus, a Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of Alexander the Great's invasion of India (now Pakistan and northwest India) mentions, without offering any detail, that independent and democratic states existed in India."
" Modern scholars note the word democracy at the time of the 3rd century BC and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature."
"Key characteristics of the gana seem to include a monarch, usually known by the name raja, and a deliberative assembly."
" At least in some states, attendance was open to all free men."
" This body also had full financial, administrative, and judicial authority."
" Other officers, who rarely receive any mention, obeyed the decisions of the assembly."
" Elected by the gana, the monarch apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of Kshatriya Varna."
" The monarch coordinated his activities with the assembly; in some states, he did so with a council of other nobles."
" The Licchavis had a primary governing body of 7,077 rajas, the heads of the most important families."
" On the other hand, the Shakyas, Koliyas, Mallas, and Licchavis, during the period around Gautama Buddha, had the assembly open to all men, rich and poor."
" Early ""republics"" or gaṇa sangha, such as Mallas, centered in the city of Kusinagara, and the Vajji (or Vriji) confederation, centered in the city of Vaishali, existed as early as the 6th century BC and persisted in some areas until the 4th century AD."
 The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the Licchavis.
 The Magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara.
 Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas.
" Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions."
"Scholars differ over how best to describe these governments, and the vague, sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements."
 Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies; other scholars focus on the upper-class domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an oligarchy or an aristocracy.
" Despite the assembly's obvious power, it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation were truly popular."
" This is reflected in the Arthashastra, an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently."
" It contains a chapter on how to deal with the sanghas, which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders, yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizens, indicating that the ""Gaṇa sanghas"" are more of an aristocratic rule, or oligarchic republic, than ""democracy""."
The Icelandic Commonwealth was established in AD 930 by refugees from Norway who had fled the unification of that country under King Harald Fairhair.
" The Commonwealth consisted of a number of clans run by chieftains, and the Althing was a combination of parliament and supreme court where disputes appealed from lower courts were settled, laws were decided, and decisions of national importance were taken."
" One such example was the Christianisation of Iceland in 1000, where the Althing decreed, in order to prevent an invasion, that all Icelanders must be baptized, and forbade celebration of pagan rituals."
" Contrary to most states, the Icelandic Commonwealth had no official leader."
"In the early 13th century, the Age of the Sturlungs, the Commonwealth began to suffer from long conflicts between warring clans."
" This, combined with pressure from the Norwegian king Haakon IV for the Icelanders to rejoin the Norwegian ""family"", led the Icelandic chieftains to accept Haakon IV as king by the signing of the Gamli sáttmáli (""Old Covenant"") in 1262."
" The Althing, however, is still Iceland's parliament, almost 800 years later."
In Europe new republics appeared in the late Middle Ages when a number of small states embraced republican systems of government.
" These were generally small, but wealthy, trading states, like the Italian city-states and the Hanseatic League, in which the merchant class had risen to prominence."
" Knud Haakonssen has noted that, by the Renaissance, Europe was divided with those states controlled by a landed elite being monarchies and those controlled by a commercial elite being republics."
"Italy was the most densely populated area of Europe, and also one with the weakest central government."
 Many of the towns thus gained considerable independence and adopted commune forms of government.
" Completely free of feudal control, the Italian city-states expanded, gaining control of the rural hinterland."
 The two most powerful were the Republic of Venice and its rival the Republic of Genoa.
" Each were large trading ports, and further expanded by using naval power to control large parts of the Mediterranean."
 It was in Italy that an ideology advocating for republics first developed.
" Writers such as Bartholomew of Lucca, Brunetto Latini, Marsilius of Padua, and Leonardo Bruni saw the medieval city-states as heirs to the legacy of Greece and Rome."
Across Europe a wealthy merchant class developed in the important trading cities.
" Despite their wealth they had little power in the feudal system dominated by the rural land owners, and across Europe began to advocate for their own privileges and powers."
" The more centralized states, such as France and England, granted limited city charters."
"In the more loosely governed Holy Roman Empire, 51 of the largest towns became free imperial cities."
 While still under the dominion of the Holy Roman Emperor most power was held locally and many adopted republican forms of government.
 The same rights to imperial immediacy were secured by the major trading cities of Switzerland.
" The towns and villages of alpine Switzerland had, courtesy of geography, also been largely excluded from central control."
" Unlike Italy and Germany, much of the rural area was thus not controlled by feudal barons, but by independent farmers who also used communal forms of government."
 When the Habsburgs tried to reassert control over the region both rural farmers and town merchants joined the rebellion.
" The Swiss were victorious, and the Swiss Confederacy was proclaimed, and Switzerland has retained a republican form of government to the present."
"Two Russian cities with a powerful merchant class—Novgorod and Pskov—also adopted republican forms of government in 12th and 13th centuries, respectively, which ended when the republics were conquered by Muscovy/Russia at the end of 15th – beginning of 16th century."
The dominant form of government for these early republics was control by a limited council of elite patricians.
" In those areas that held elections, property qualifications or guild membership limited both who could vote and who could run."
 In many states no direct elections were held and council members were hereditary or appointed by the existing council.
" This left the great majority of the population without political power, and riots and revolts by the lower classes were common."
 The late Middle Ages saw more than 200 such risings in the towns of the Holy Roman Empire.
" Similar revolts occurred in Italy, notably the Ciompi Revolt in Florence."
"Following the collapse of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and establishment of the Turkish Anatolian Beyliks, the Ahiler merchant fraternities established a state centered on Ankara that is sometimes compared to the Italian mercantile republics."
"While the classical writers had been the primary ideological source for the republics of Italy, in Northern Europe, the Protestant Reformation would be used as justification for establishing new republics."
" Most important was Calvinist theology, which developed in the Swiss Confederacy, one of the largest and most powerful of the medieval republics."
" John Calvin did not call for the abolition of monarchy, but he advanced the doctrine that the faithful had the duty to overthrow irreligious monarchs."
 Advocacy for republics appeared in the writings of the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion.
Calvinism played an important role in the republican revolts in England and the Netherlands.
" Like the city-states of Italy and the Hanseatic League, both were important trading centres, with a large merchant class prospering from the trade with the New World."
 Large parts of the population of both areas also embraced Calvinism.
" During the Dutch Revolt (beginning in 1566), the Dutch Republic emerged from rejection of Spanish Habsburg rule."
" However, the country did not adopt the republican form of government immediately: in the formal declaration of independence (Act of Abjuration, 1581), the throne of king Philip was only declared vacant, and the Dutch magistrates asked the Duke of Anjou, queen Elizabeth of England and prince William of Orange, one after another, to replace Philip."
" It took until 1588 before the Estates (the Staten, the representative assembly at the time) decided to vest the sovereignty of the country in themselves."
" Spearheaded by the Puritans and funded by the merchants of London, the revolt was a success, and King Charles I was executed."
" In England James Harrington, Algernon Sidney, and John Milton became some of the first writers to argue for rejecting monarchy and embracing a republican form of government."
" The English Commonwealth was short lived, and the monarchy was soon restored."
" The Dutch Republic continued in name until 1795, but by the mid-18th century the stadtholder had become a de facto monarch."
 Calvinists were also some of the earliest settlers of the British and Dutch colonies of North America.
"Along with these initial republican revolts, early modern Europe also saw a great increase in monarchical power."
 The era of absolute monarchy replaced the limited and decentralized monarchies that had existed in most of the Middle Ages.
 It also saw a reaction against the total control of the monarch as a series of writers created the ideology known as liberalism.
Most of these Enlightenment thinkers were far more interested in ideas of constitutional monarchy than in republics.
" The Cromwell regime had discredited republicanism, and most thinkers felt that republics ended in either anarchy or tyranny."
 Thus philosophers like Voltaire opposed absolutism while at the same time being strongly pro-monarchy.
"Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu praised republics, and looked on the city-states of Greece as a model."
" However, both also felt that a state like France, with 20 million people, would be impossible to govern as a republic."
" Rousseau admired the republican experiment in Corsica (1755–1769) and described his ideal political structure of small, self-governing communes."
" Montesquieu felt that a city-state should ideally be a republic, but maintained that a limited monarchy was better suited to a state with a larger territory."
"The American Revolution began as a rejection only of the authority of the British Parliament over the colonies, not of the monarchy."
" The failure of the British monarch to protect the colonies from what they considered the infringement of their rights to representative government, the monarch's branding of those requesting redress as traitors, and his support for sending combat troops to demonstrate authority resulted in widespread perception of the British monarchy as tyrannical."
With the United States Declaration of Independence the leaders of the revolt firmly rejected the monarchy and embraced republicanism.
" The leaders of the revolution were well versed in the writings of the French liberal thinkers, and also in history of the classical republics."
 John Adams had notably written a book on republics throughout history.
" In addition, the widely distributed and popularly read-aloud tract Common Sense, by Thomas Paine,  succinctly and eloquently laid out the case for republican ideals and independence to the larger public."
" The Constitution of the United States, ratified in 1789, created a relatively strong federal republic to replace the relatively weak confederation under the first attempt at a national government with the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union ratified in 1781."
" The first ten amendments to the Constitution, called the United States Bill of Rights, guaranteed certain natural rights fundamental to republican ideals that justified the Revolution."
The French Revolution was also not republican at its outset.
 Only after the Flight to Varennes removed most of the remaining sympathy for the king was a republic declared and Louis XVI sent to the guillotine.
 The stunning success of France in the French Revolutionary Wars saw republics spread by force of arms across much of Europe as a series of client republics were set up across the continent.
" The rise of Napoleon saw the end of the French First Republic and her Sister Republics, each replaced by ""popular monarchies""."
" Throughout the Napoleonic period, the victors extinguished many of the oldest republics on the continent, including the Republic of Venice, the Republic of Genoa, and the Dutch Republic."
 They were eventually transformed into monarchies or absorbed into neighbouring monarchies.
Outside Europe another group of republics was created as the Napoleonic Wars allowed the states of Latin America to gain their independence.
 Liberal ideology had only a limited impact on these new republics.
 The main impetus was the local European descended Creole population in conflict with the Peninsulares—governors sent from overseas.
" The majority of the population in most of Latin America was of either African or Amerindian descent, and the Creole elite had little interest in giving these groups power and broad-based popular sovereignty."
" Simón Bolívar, both the main instigator of the revolts and one of its most important theorists, was sympathetic to liberal ideals but felt that Latin America lacked the social cohesion for such a system to function and advocated autocracy as necessary."
In Mexico this autocracy briefly took the form of a monarchy in the First Mexican Empire.
" Due to the Peninsular War, the Portuguese court was relocated to Brazil in 1808."
" Brazil gained independence as a monarchy on September 7, 1822, and the Empire of Brazil lasted until 1889."
 In the other states various forms of autocratic republic existed until most were liberalized at the end of the 20th century.
"The French Second Republic was created in 1848, but abolished by Napoleon III who proclaimed himself Emperor in 1852."
" The French Third Republic was established in 1870, when a civil revolutionary committee refused to accept Napoleon III's surrender during the Franco-Prussian War."
" Spain briefly became the First Spanish Republic in 1873–74, but the monarchy was soon restored."
" By the start of the 20th century France, Switzerland and San Marino remained the only republics in Europe."
" This changed when, after the 1908 Lisbon Regicide, the 5 October 1910 revolution established the Portuguese Republic."
"In East Asia, China had seen considerable anti-Qing sentiment during the 19th century, and a number of protest movements developed calling for constitutional monarchy."
" The most important leader of these efforts was Sun Yat-sen, whose Three Principles of the People combined American, European, and Chinese ideas."
" Under his leadership the Republic of China was proclaimed on January 1, 1912."
"Republicanism expanded significantly in the aftermath of World War I, when several of the largest European empires collapsed: the Russian Empire (1917), German Empire (1918), Austro-Hungarian Empire (1918), and Ottoman Empire (1922) were all replaced by republics."
" New states gained independence during this turmoil, and many of these, such as Ireland, Poland, Finland and Czechoslovakia, chose republican forms of government."
" Following Greece's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22), the monarchy was briefly replaced by the Second Hellenic Republic (1924–35)."
" In 1931, the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39) resulted in the Spanish Civil War that would be the prelude of World War II."
" The United States began to have considerable influence in East Asia in the later part of the 19th century, with Protestant missionaries playing a central role."
 The liberal and republican writers of the west also exerted influence.
 These combined with native Confucian inspired political philosophy that had long argued that the populace had the right to reject unjust government that had lost the Mandate of Heaven.
"Two short-lived republics were proclaimed in East Asia, the Republic of Formosa and the First Philippine Republic."
"In the years following World War II, most of the remaining European colonies gained their independence, and most became republics."
 The two largest colonial powers were France and the United Kingdom.
 Republican France encouraged the establishment of republics in its former colonies.
 The United Kingdom attempted to follow the model it had for its earlier settler colonies of creating independent Commonwealth realms still linked under the same monarchy.
" While most of the settler colonies and the smaller states of the Caribbean retained this system, it was rejected by the newly independent countries in Africa and Asia, which revised their constitutions and became republics."
"Britain followed a different model in the Middle East; it installed local monarchies in several colonies and mandates including Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen and Libya."
 In subsequent decades revolutions and coups overthrew a number of monarchs and installed republics.
" Several monarchies remain, and the Middle East is the only part of the world where several large states are ruled by monarchs with almost complete political control."
"In the wake of the First World War, the Russian monarchy fell during the Russian Revolution."
" The Russian Provisional Government was established in its place on the lines of a liberal republic, but this was overthrown by the Bolsheviks who went on to establish the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."
 This was the first republic established under Marxist-Leninist ideology.
" Communism was wholly opposed to monarchy, and became an important element of many republican movements during the 20th century."
" The Russian Revolution spread into Mongolia, and overthrew its theocratic monarchy in 1924."
" In the aftermath of the Second World War the communists gradually gained control of Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Albania, ensuring that the states were reestablished as socialist republics rather than monarchies."
 It was embraced by many national liberation movements during decolonization.
" In Vietnam, communist republicans pushed aside the Nguyễn Dynasty, and monarchies in neighbouring Laos and Cambodia were overthrown by communist movements in the 1970s."
" Arab socialism contributed to a series of revolts and coups that saw the monarchies of Egypt, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen ousted."
 In Africa Marxist-Leninism and African socialism led to the end of monarchy and the proclamation of republics in states such as Burundi and Ethiopia.
"Islamic political philosophy has a long history of opposition to absolute monarchy, notably in the work of Al-Farabi."
" Sharia law took precedence over the will of the ruler, and electing rulers by means of the Shura was an important doctrine."
" While the early caliphate maintained the principles of an elected ruler, later states became hereditary or military dictatorships though many maintained some pretense of a consultative shura."
None of these states are typically referred to as republics.
" The current usage of republic in Muslim countries is borrowed from the western meaning, adopted into the language in the late 19th century."
" The 20th century saw republicanism become an important idea in much of the Middle East, as monarchies were removed in many states of the region."
" Some nations, such as Indonesia and Azerbaijan, began as secular."
" In Iran, the 1979 revolution overthrew the monarchy and created an Islamic republic based on the ideas of Islamic democracy."
"With no monarch, most modern republics use the title president for the head of state."
" Originally used to refer to the presiding officer of a committee or governing body in Great Britain the usage was also applied to political leaders, including the leaders of some of the Thirteen Colonies (originally Virginia in 1608); in full, the ""President of the Council""."
 The first republic to adopt the title was the United States of America.
 Keeping its usage as the head of a committee the President of the Continental Congress was the leader of the original congress.
 When the new constitution was written the title of President of the United States was conferred on the head of the new executive branch.
"If the head of state of a republic is also the head of government, this is called a presidential system."
 A full-presidential system has a president with substantial authority and a central political role.
"In other states the legislature is dominant and the presidential role is almost purely ceremonial and apolitical, such as in Germany, Italy, India, and Trinidad and Tobago."
 These states are parliamentary republics and operate similarly to constitutional monarchies with parliamentary systems where the power of the monarch is also greatly circumscribed.
" In parliamentary systems the head of government, most often titled prime minister, exercises the most real political power."
" Semi-presidential systems have a president as an active head of state with important powers, but they also have a prime minister as a head of government with important powers."
"The rules for appointing the president and the leader of the government, in some republics permit the appointment of a president and a prime minister who have opposing political convictions: in France, when the members of the ruling cabinet and the president come from opposing political factions, this situation is called cohabitation."
"In some countries, like Bosnia and Herzegovina, San Marino, and Switzerland, the head of state is not a single person but a committee (council) of several persons holding that office."
" The Roman Republic had two consuls, elected for a one-year term by the comitia centuriata, consisting of all adult, freeborn males who could prove citizenship."
"In liberal democracies, presidents are elected, either directly by the people or indirectly by a parliament or council."
" Typically in presidential and semi-presidential systems the president is directly elected by the people, or is indirectly elected as done in the United States."
" In that country the president is officially elected by an electoral college, chosen by the States, all of which do so by direct election of the electors."
 The indirect election of the president through the electoral college conforms to the concept of republic as one with a system of indirect election.
" In the opinion of some, direct election confers legitimacy upon the president and gives the office much of its political power."
" However, this concept of legitimacy differs from that expressed in the United States Constitution which established the legitimacy of the United States president as resulting from the signing of the Constitution by nine states."
" The idea that direct election is required for legitimacy also contradicts the spirit of the Great Compromise, whose actual result was manifest in the clause that provides voters in smaller states with more representation in presidential selection than those in large states; for example citizens of Wyoming in 2016 had 3."
6 times as much electoral vote representation as citizens of California.
In states with a parliamentary system the president is usually elected by the parliament.
" This indirect election subordinates the president to the parliament, and also gives the president limited legitimacy and turns most presidential powers into reserve powers that can only be exercised under rare circumstance."
" There are exceptions where elected presidents have only ceremonial powers, such as in Ireland."
The distinction between a republic and a monarchy is not always clear.
" The constitutional monarchies of the former British Empire and Western Europe today have almost all real political power vested in the elected representatives, with the monarchs only holding either theoretical powers, no powers or rarely used reserve powers."
 Real legitimacy for political decisions comes from the elected representatives and is derived from the will of the people.
" While hereditary monarchies remain in place, political power is derived from the people as in a republic."
 These states are thus sometimes referred to as crowned republics.
"Terms such as ""liberal republic"" are also used to describe all of the modern liberal democracies."
There are also self-proclaimed republics that act similarly to monarchies with absolute power vested in the leader and passed down from father to son.
 North Korea and Syria are two notable examples where a son has inherited political control.
" There is no constitutional requirement that power be passed down within one family, but it has occurred in practice."
"There are also elective monarchies where ultimate power is vested in a monarch, but the monarch is chosen by some manner of election."
" A current example of such a state is Malaysia where the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected every five years by the Conference of Rulers composed of the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states, and the Vatican City-State, where the pope is selected by cardinal-electors, currently all cardinals under a specific age."
" While rare today, elective monarchs were common in the past."
" The Holy Roman Empire is an important example, where each new emperor was chosen by a group of electors."
" Islamic states also rarely employed primogeniture, instead relying on various forms of election to choose a monarch's successor."
"The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had an elective monarchy, with a wide suffrage of some 500,000 nobles."
" The system, known as the Golden Liberty, had developed as a method for powerful landowners to control the crown."
" The proponents of this system looked to classical examples, and the writings of the Italian Renaissance, and called their elective monarchy a rzeczpospolita, based on res publica."
In general being a republic also implies sovereignty as for the state to be ruled by the people it cannot be controlled by a foreign power.
" There are important exceptions to this, for example, republics in the Soviet Union were member states which had to meet three criteria to be named republics:
"
"be on the periphery of the Soviet Union so as to be able to take advantage of their theoretical right to secede;
"
"be economically strong enough to be self-sufficient upon secession; and
"
be named after at least one million people of the ethnic group which should make up the majority population of said republic.
"It is sometimes argued that the former Soviet Union was also a supra-national republic, based on the claim that the member states were different nation states."
"The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a federal entity composed of six republics (Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia)."
" Each republic had its parliament, government, institute of citizenship, constitution, etc."
", but certain functions were delegated to the federation (army, monetary matters)."
 Each republic also had a right of self-determination according to the conclusions of the second session of the AVNOJ and according to the federal constitution.
"States of the United States are required, like the federal government, to be republican in form, with final authority resting with the people."
" This was required because the states were intended to create and enforce most domestic laws, with the exception of areas delegated to the federal government and prohibited to the states."
 The founding fathers of the country intended most domestic laws to be handled by the states.
" Requiring the states to be a republic in form was seen as protecting the citizens' rights and preventing a state from becoming a dictatorship or monarchy, and reflected unwillingness on the part of the original 13 states (all independent republics) to unite with other states that were not republics."
" Additionally, this requirement ensured that only other republics could join the union."
"In the example of the United States, the original 13 British colonies became independent states after the American Revolution, each having a republican form of government."
 These independent states initially formed a loose confederation called the United States and then later formed the current United States by ratifying the current U.
 Any state joining the union later was also required to be a republic.
"In Switzerland, all cantons can be considered to have a republican form of government."
" Several Romance-speaking cantons are also officially referred to as republics, reflecting their history and will of independence within the Swiss Confederation."
 Notable examples are the Republic and Canton of Geneva and the Republic and Canton of Ticino.
The term republic originated from the writers of the Renaissance as a descriptive term for states that were not monarchies.
" These writers, such as Machiavelli, also wrote important prescriptive works describing how such governments should function."
 These ideas of how a government and society should be structured is the basis for an ideology known as classical republicanism or civic humanism.
" This ideology is based on the Roman Republic and the city states of Ancient Greece and focuses on ideals such as civic virtue, rule of law and mixed government."
This understanding of a republic as a distinct form of government from a liberal democracy is one of the main theses of the Cambridge School of historical analysis.
 Pocock who in 1975 argued that a series of scholars had expressed a consistent set of republican ideals.
" These writers included Machiavelli, Milton, Montesquieu and the founders of the United States of America."
Pocock argued that this was an ideology with a history and principles distinct from liberalism.
" These ideas were embraced by a number of different writers, including Quentin Skinner, Philip Pettit and Cass Sunstein."
" These subsequent writers have further explored the history of the idea, and also outlined how a modern republic should function."
"A distinct set of definitions of the term ""republic"" evolved in the United States, where the term is often equated with ""representative democracy."
""" This narrower understanding of the term was originally developed by James Madison and notably employed in Federalist Paper No."
" This meaning was widely adopted early in the history of the United States, including in Noah Webster's dictionary of 1828."
 It was a novel meaning to the term; representative democracy was not an idea mentioned by Machiavelli and did not exist in the classical republics.
" There is also evidence that contemporaries of Madison considered the meaning of ""republic"" to reflect the broader definition found elsewhere, as is the case with a quotation of Benjamin Franklin taken from the notes of James McHenry where the question is put forth, ""a Republic or a Monarchy?""."
"The term republic does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, but it does appear in Article IV of the Constitution, which ""guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government."
""" What exactly the writers of the constitution felt this should mean is uncertain."
" Borden (1849), declared that the definition of republic was a ""political question"" in which it would not intervene."
" Cruikshank (1875), the court ruled that the ""equal rights of citizens"" were inherent to the idea of a republic."
"However, the term republic is not synonymous with the republican form."
" The republican form is defined as one in which the powers of sovereignty are vested in the people and are exercised by the people, either directly, or through representatives chosen by the people, to whom those powers are specially delegated."
"Beyond these basic definitions, the word republic has a number of other connotations."
" Paul Adams observes that republic is most often used in the United States as a synonym for ""state"" or ""government,"" but with more positive connotations than either of those terms."
  Republicanism is often referred to as the founding ideology of the United States.
 Traditionally scholars believed this American republicanism was a derivation of the classical liberal ideologies of John Locke and others developed in Europe.
A political philosophy of republicanism that formed during the Renaissance period and initiated by Machiavelli was thought to have had little impact on the founders of the United States.
" In the 1960s and 1970s, a revisionist school led by the likes of Bernard Bailyn began to argue that republicanism was just as or even more important than liberalism in the creation of the United States."
 This issue is still much disputed and scholars like Isaac Kramnick completely reject this view.

"Governance comprises all of the processes of governing – whether undertaken by the government of a state, by a market, or by a network – over a social system (family, tribe, formal or informal organization, a territory or across territories) and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an organized society."
" It relates to ""the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social norms and institutions""."
"In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions."
A variety of entities (known generically as governing bodies) can govern.
" The most formal is a government, a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given geopolitical system (such as a state) by establishing laws."
" Other types of governing include an organization (such as a corporation recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group (chiefdom, tribe, gang, family, religious denomination, etc."
" In business and outsourcing relationships, Governance Frameworks are built into relational contracts that foster long-term collaboration and innovation."
"Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained
"
" The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given organization and, externally, with its business partners."
" As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results."
" For instance, a government may operate as a democracy where citizens vote on who should govern and the public good is the goal, while a non-profit organization or a corporation may be governed by a small board of directors and pursue more specific aims."
"In addition, a variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence the process of governing."
" These include lobbies, think tanks, political parties, non-government organizations, community and media."
"Most institutions of higher education offer governance as an area of study, such as the Balsillie School of International Affairs, Munk School of Global Affairs, Sciences Po Paris, Graduate Institute Geneva, Hertie School, and London School of Economics, among others."
"Like government, the word governance derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb kubernaein [kubernáo] (meaning to steer, the metaphorical sense first being attested in Plato)."
" Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early-modern England, when the phrase ""governance of the realm"" appears in works by William Tyndale and in royal correspondence from James V of Scotland to Henry VIII of England."
" The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) appears in Charles Plummer's The Governance of England (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin manuscript by John Fortescue, also known as The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy)."
" This usage of ""governance"" to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in Sidney Low's seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians."
"However, the use of the term governance in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the UN, the IMF and the World Bank."
"Governance often refers to a particular level of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular 'field' of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular 'model' of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance)."
" Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among political, public sector, voluntary, and private sector organizations."
"In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist."
" These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not."
" Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to states, to corporations, to non-profits, to NGOs, to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex outsourcing relationships), to project teams, and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity."
Most theories of governance as process arose out of neoclassical economics.
" These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons."
There is a distinction between the concepts of governance and politics.
" Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common policy."
" Governance, on the other hand, conveys the administrative and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones."
" Such an argument continues to assume the possibility of the traditional separation between ""politics"" and ""administration""."
" Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both ""governance"" and ""politics"" involve aspects of power and accountability."
"In general terms, public governance occurs in three broad ways:
"
"Through networks involving public-private partnerships (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations;
"
"Through the use of market mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation;
"
Through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and the state bureaucracy.
"Private governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, dispute resolution organizations, or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the ""quality of life and opportunities of the larger public."
"""  Simply put, private—not public—entities are making public policy."
" For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers."
" The term ""public policy"" should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by government."
 Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector.
" If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is ""governmental policy,"" which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making."
"Global governance is defined as ""the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, right and obligations are established, and differences are mediated""."
" In contrast to the traditional meaning of ""governance"", some authors like James Rosenau have used the term ""global governance"" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority."
 The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states.
" The term, however, can apply wherever a group of free equals needs to form a regular relationship."
"The Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, where various stakeholders interact and make decisions regarding collective issues, thus creating or reinforcing social norms and institutions."
" It is postulated that governance processes can be found in any society, and unlike other approaches, that these can be observed and analysed from a non-normative perspective."
" It proposes a methodology based on five main analytical units: problems, actors, norms, processes and ""nodal points""."
 These logically articulated analytical units make up a coherent methodology aimed at being used as a tool for empirical social policy research.
Nonprofit governance has a dual focus: achieving the organization's social mission and ensuring the organization is viable.
" Both responsibilities relate to fiduciary responsibility that a board of trustees (sometimes called directors, or Board, or Management Committee—the terms are interchangeable) has with respect to the exercise of authority over the explicit actions the organization takes."
 Public trust and accountability is an essential aspect of organizational viability so it achieves the social mission in a way that is respected by those whom the organization serves and the society in which it is located.
"Corporate organizations often use the word governance to describe both:
"
"The manner in which boards or their like direct a corporation
"
"The laws and customs (rules) applying to that directionCorporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control a corporation."
 Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many players involved (the stakeholders) and the corporate goals.
" The principal players include the shareholders, management, and the board of directors."
" Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large."
"The first documented use of the word ""corporate governance"" is by Richard Eells (1960, p."
" 108) to denote ""the structure and functioning of the corporate polity""."
" The ""corporate government"" concept itself is older and was already used in finance textbooks at the beginning of the 20th century (Becht, Bolton, Röell 2004)."
Project governance is the management framework within which project decisions are made.
 Its role is to provide a repeatable and robust system through which an organization can manage its capital investments—project governance handles tasks such as outlining the relationships between all groups involved and describing the flow of information to all stakeholders.
a concept in political ecology which promotes environmental policy that advocates for sustainable human activity (i.
 that governance should be based upon environmental principles).
the processes of decision-making involved in the control and management of the environment and natural resources.
" The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), define environmental governance as the ""multi-level interactions (i."
", local, national, international/global) among, but not limited to, three main actors, i."
", state, market, and civil society, which interact with one another, whether in formal and informal ways; in formulating and implementing policies in response to environment-related demands and inputs from the society; bound by rules, procedures, processes, and widely accepted behavior; possessing characteristics of 'good governance'; for the purpose of attaining environmentally-sustainable development."
Land governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure.
" It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land."
" In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as ‘land grabbing’."
 The operational dimension of land governance is land administration.
"Security of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy."
" Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business – hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance."
There is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance.
" For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called 'land grabbing', was partly made possible by the Washington Consensus-inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries."
" Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries."
"The quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as land administration: ‘the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational’."
 And another factor is accountability:  the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities.
"The main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT), endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS)."
"According to the WHO, ""governance in the health sector refers to a wide range of steering and rule-making related functions carried out by governments/decisions makers as they seek to achieve national health policy objectives that are conducive to universal health coverage."
""" A national health policy is a complex and dynamic process, which changes from State to State according to the political, historical and socio-economic situation prevailing in the country."
" Mainly it seeks to strengthen the health system, making sure that they are capable of meeting the health needs of targeted populations."
"More broadly, health governance requires a synergistic set of policies, many of which reside in sectors other than health as well as governors beyond the national governments, which must be supported by structures and mechanisms that enable collaboration."
" For instance, in the European context, it was developed a health policy framework called Health 2020 as a result of the collaboration between State members in the region."
" It gives policy-makers a vision, a strategic path and a set of priorities to improve health, guaranteeing that it is more equitable and sustainable."
", changing population demographics and epidemiology, widening social inequalities, and a context of financial uncertainty) have influenced health system priorities and subsequently the setting of the health governance function."
 These trends have resulted in the emergence of joint actions of all stakeholders to achieve seminal changes in 21st-century societies.
" It is also important to consider that people have witnessed a global shift from traditional and reactive healthcare to proactive care, mainly enabled by investment in advanced technologies."
" Recent artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning have made possible the automation as well as the standardisation of many processes in healthcare, which have also brought to light challenges to the existing governance structures."
 One of these challenges concerns the ownership of health data.
"Internet governance was defined by the World Summit on the Information Society as ""the development and application by Governments, the private sector and civil society, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet."
""" Internet governance deals with how much influence each sector of society should have on the development of the Internet, such as to what extent the state should be able to censor it, and how issues on the Internet, such as cyber-bullying, should be approached."
IT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management.
 The goal of clear governance is to assure that investment in IT generates business value and mitigates the risks that are associated with IT projects.
Blockchains offer a novel way to enforce agreements and achieve cooperation and coordination.
" The main technical features of blockchains support transparency and traceability of records, information immutability and reliability, and autonomous enforcement of agreements."
" As such, blockchains will affect traditional forms of governance—most notably, contractual and relational governance—and may change the way to organize collaborations between individuals and between organizations."
 Blockchain governance relies on a set of protocols and code-based rules.
" As an original governance mode, it departs from an enforcement through the law (as in contractual governance) or through the value of future relationships (as in relational governance)."
Regulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending.
 The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules.
" It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic."
 The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other.
" While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance."
 The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation.
Participatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state.
 The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues.
 Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement.
" In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement."
") Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way."
" In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the ""framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided"", adding further that ""because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction."
Multi-level governance is the concept and study of the fact that many intertangled authority structures are present in a global political economy.
" The theory of multi-level governance, developed mainly by Liesbet Hooghe and Gary Marks, arose from increasing European integration, particularly through the European Union."
" José Manuel Barroso, former President of the European Commission, has stated that ""the multilevel system of governance on which our European regional policy is based provides a key boost to the Union's competitive edge"" and that, in times of economic crisis, ""multilevel governance must be a priority."
" It represents the established ethical principles, or 'norms', that shape and steer the entire governing process."
" It is important to note that there are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it."
" While some believe metagovernance to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can ""potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor"" who wishes to influence the governing process."
" Examples of this include the publishing of codes of conduct at the highest level of international government, and media focus on specific issues at the sociocultural level."
" Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted 'norms'."
" The fact that 'norms' can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system."
"A collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties."
Security sector governance (SSG) is a subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about security and their implementation within the security sector of a single state.
 SSG applies the principles of good governance to the security sector in question.
"When discussing governance in particular organizations, the quality of governance within the organization is often compared to a standard of good governance."
" In the case of a business or of a non-profit organization, for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability."
" ""Good governance"" implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the ""agents"") to respect the rights and interests of the stakeholders (the ""principals""), in a spirit of democracy."
Good governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources.
" These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development."
 Unsurprisingly different organizations have defined governance and good governance differently to promote different normative ends.
the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development.
"The Worldwide Governance Indicators project of the World Bank defines governance as:
"
the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised.
"This considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them."
"the use of institutions, structures of authority and even collaboration to allocate resources and coordinate or control activity in society or the economy."
"According to the United Nations Development Programme's Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America:
"
Governance has been defined as the rules of the political system to solve conflicts between actors and adopt decision (legality).
" It has also been used to describe the ""proper functioning of institutions and their acceptance by the public"" (legitimacy)."
 And it has been used to invoke the efficacy of government and the achievement of consensus by democratic means (participation).
The effectiveness of governments is not a straightforward and consentient type of governance.
 Measurement and conceptualization of effectiveness is controversial and often used interchangeably with good governance.
" However, during the period of 1996–2018, an effort was made by the World Bank to create a comparable measure of the performance of governments; the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI)."
" The WGI is constituted by over 30 databases which are rescaled and categorized into six categories, among one of these is government effectiveness."
" According to this category, effective governance is composed by five aspects: the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service, the degree of the government's independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies."
" In short, effective governance is about quality of service, the independence of government and the quality of policies and implementation."
"Adding to these components, one might argue that responsiveness to citizen's needs is high in an effective government."
" Acting according to these needs, effectiveness is achieved by transparent, decentralized and neutral structures, that are consistent and disciplined."
" Therefore, efficient financial management, high-quality and committed personnel and formalized and standardized ways of processes is needed."
" For the latter, governments became much more efficient with the arise of bureaucracies."
" Nevertheless, governments in a rapidly changing environment need to be able to adapt quickly, so being bounded by rigid structures of functioning could work as a detriment."
"Since the conceptualization of effective governance is not onefold, some more components that might constitute it are suggested: “It should be small in extent with limited intervention in the economy; a clear vision and processes; committed quality personnel that can formulate and implement policies and projects; comprehensive participation with the public; efficient financial management; responsive, transparent and decentralized structures and political stability”."
"The components of effective governance described above all have a domestic character, within the boundaries of the national territory, national policies and about the inhabitants of a country."
" This is the internal aspect of effective governance, which mainly focuses on national services and policies."
" The external aspect of effective governance on the other hand, exclusively focuses on the international domain of politics."
" It entails the state's capacity to exercise its rights and fulfil its duties in alignment with international law, the representation of its people in the international political landscape and its participation in international relations."
The purpose of effective governance in the internal aspect is to be the sovereign within its national territory; in the external aspect to wield sovereignty over international relations.
" For this reason, it is a necessary characteristic of the state to have unrestricted capacity to act, without any form of dependence in both state and international law."
"In an attempt to identify predictors of effective government, a study was done to investigate what characteristics of the state are more deeply established by effective governance."
" The most striking conclusion was that effective governance has a big share in the economic growth and developing, although on the long term."
" However, this is a bi-directional relationship: economic growth does lead to more effective governance as well."
" Moreover, effective governance does have a positive influence on reducing corruption, strengthening political stability, contribution to improved rule of law and improved government spending and accountability."
" As is the case with economic development, it is plausible the argue that effective governance and the named predictors are a positive feedback cycle: they reinforce each other, and so indirectly themselves."
"When a state fails to govern effectively, this does not simply imply the absence of the characteristics of effective governance."
" First of all, the absence of effective governance is lack of capacity of the state to supply its inhabitants with political goods, such as rights and freedoms."
" Zartman describes how absence of effective governance comes about: “as the disintegration ofstate structure, authority (legitimate power), law, and political order”."
" Five main characteristics are to be differentiated in the absence of effective governance: disorganizing of the structure of the processes in the state, violent conflicts, violations of human rights and social fragmentation, all of which have an endogenous character."
"Since the early years of the 2000s (decade), efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the world."
 Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise.
" A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments."
 Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations.
 An example of a peer assessment is the African Peer Review Mechanism.
" Examples of self-assessments are country-led assessments that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level."
"One of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the Worldwide Governance Indicators project, developed by members of the World Bank and the World Bank Institute."
" The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption."
" To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the World Bank Governance Surveys, which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country's own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption."
A Worldwide Governance Index (WGI) was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation.
" The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development."
" Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries."
" The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability."
 Section 10 of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.
 federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format.
The International Budget Partnership (IBP) launched the Open Budget Initiative in 2006 with the release of the first Open Budget Survey (OBS).
 The OBS is a comprehensive analysis and survey that evaluates whether central governments give the public access to budget documents and provide opportunities for public participation in the budget process.
" To measure the overall commitment to transparency, the IBP created Open Budget Index (OBI), which assigns a score to each country based on the results of the survey."
" While the OBS is released biannually, the IBP recently released a new OBS Tracker, which serves as an online tool for civil society, the media, and other actors to monitor in real time whether governments are releasing eight key budget documents."
" The Open Budget Index data are used by the Open Government Partnership, development aid agencies, and increasingly investors in the private sector as key indicators of governance, particularly fiscal transparency and management of public funds."
" Examples of country-led assessments include the Indonesian Democracy Index, monitoring of the Millennium Development Goal 9 on Human Rights and Democratic Governance in Mongolia and the Gross National Happiness Index in Bhutan."
Section 10 of the Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act (GPRAMA) requires U.
" federal agencies to publish their performance plans and reports in machine-readable format, thereby providing the basis for evaluating the quality of their performance of the governance functions entrusted to them, as specified in their strategic objectives and performance indicators."
"  Publishing performance reports openly on the Web in a standard, machine-readable format is good practice for all organizations whose plans and reports should be matters of public record."

"The Prime Minister of India (IAST: Bhārat ke Pradhānamantrī), officially the Prime Minister of the Republic of India, is the leader of the executive branch of the Government of India."
 The prime minister is the chief adviser to the President of India and the head of the Union Council of Ministers.
" They can be a member of any of the two houses of the Parliament of India—the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of the States); but has to be a member of the political party or coalition, having a majority in the Lok Sabha."
The prime minister is the senior-most member of cabinet in the executive of government in a parliamentary system.
 The prime minister selects and can dismiss members of the cabinet; allocates posts to members within the government; and is the presiding member and chairperson of the cabinet.
The Union Cabinet headed by the prime minister is appointed by the President of India to assist the latter in the administration of the affairs of the executive.
 Union cabinet is collectively responsible to the Lok Sabha as per Article 75(3) of the Constitution of India.
 The prime minister has to enjoy the confidence of a majority in the Lok Sabha and shall resign if they are unable to prove majority when instructed by the president.
India follows a parliamentary system in which the prime minister is the presiding head of the government and chief of the executive of the government.
" In such systems, the head of state, or, the head of state's official representative (i."
", the monarch, president, or governor-general) usually holds a purely ceremonial position and acts—on most matters—only on the advice of the prime minister."
The prime minister—if they are not already—shall become a member of parliament within six months of beginning his/her tenure.
 A prime minister is expected to work with other central ministers to ensure the passage of bills by the parliament.
 The first few decades after 1947 saw the Indian National Congress' (INC) almost complete domination over the political map of India.
 India's first prime minister—Jawaharlal Nehru—took oath on 15 August 1947.
" Nehru went on to serve as prime minister for 17 consecutive years, winning four general elections in the process."
" After the death of Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri—a former home minister and a leader of the Congress party—ascended to the position of Prime Minister."
" Shashtri subsequently died of a reported heart attack in Tashkent, after signing the Tashkent Declaration."
"After Shastri, Indira Gandhi—Nehru's daughter—was elected as the country's first woman prime minister."
" Indira's first term in office lasted 11 years, in which she took steps such as nationalisation of banks; end of allowances and political posts, which were received by members of the royal families of the erstwhile princely states of British India."
" In addition, events such as the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971; the establishment of a sovereign Bangladesh; accession of Sikkim to India, through a referendum in 1975; and India's first nuclear test in Pokhran occurred during Indira's first term."
" In 1975, President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed—on Indira's advice—imposed a state of emergency, therefore, bestowing the government with the power to rule by decree, the period is known for human right violations."
"After widespread protests, the emergency was lifted in 1977, and a general election was to be held."
" All of the political parties of the opposition—after the conclusion of the emergency—fought together against the Congress, under the umbrella of the Janata Party, in the general election of 1977, and were successful in defeating the Congress."
" Subsequently, Morarji Desai—a former deputy prime minister—became the first non-Congress prime minister of the country."
" The government of Prime Minister Desai was composed of groups with opposite ideologies, in which unity and co-ordination were difficult to maintain."
" Ultimately, after two and a half years as PM; on 28 July 1979, Morarji tendered his resignation to the president; and his government fell."
" Thereafter, Charan Singh—a deputy prime minister in Desai's cabinet—with outside, conditional support from Congress, proved a majority in Lok Sabha and took oath as prime minister."
" However, Congress pulled its support shortly after, and Singh had to resign; he had a tenure of 5 months, the shortest in the history of the office."
"In 1980, after a three-year absence, the Congress returned to power with an absolute majority."
" During her second tenure, Operation Blue Star—an Indian Army operation inside the Golden Temple, the most sacred site in Sikhism—was conducted, resulting in reportedly thousands of deaths."
" Subsequently, on 31 October 1984, Gandhi was shot dead by Satwant Singh and Beant Singh—two of her bodyguards—in the garden of her residence at 1, Safdarjung Road, New Delhi."
"After Indira, Rajiv—her eldest son and 40 years old at the time—was sworn in on the evening of 31 October 1984, becoming the youngest person ever to hold the office of prime minister."
" In the subsequent general election, the Congress secured an absolute majority, winning 401 of 552 seats in the Lok Sabha, the maximum number received by any party in the history of India."
" Vishwanath Pratap Singh—first finance minister and then later defence minister in Gandhi's cabinet—uncovered irregularities, in what became known as the Bofors scandal, during his stint at the Ministry of Defence; Singh was subsequently expelled from Congress and formed the Janata Dal and—with the help of several anti-Congress parties—also formed the National Front, a coalition of many political parties."
"In the general election of 1989, the National Front—with outside support from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Left Front—came to power."
" During a tenure of less than a year, Singh and his government accepted the Mandal Commission's recommendations."
" Singh's tenure came to an end after he ordered the arrest of BJP member Lal Krishna Advani, as a result, BJP withdrew its outside support to the government, V."
 Singh lost the subsequent vote-of-no-confidence 146–320 and had to resign.
" Singh's resignation, Chandra Shekhar along with 64 members of parliament (MPs) floated the Samajwadi Janata Party (Rashtriya), and proved a majority in the Lok Sabha with support from Congress."
" But Shekhar's premiership did not last long, Congress proceeded to withdraw its support; Shekhar's government fell as a result, and new elections were announced."
"In the general election of 1991, Congress—under the leadership of P."
 Narasimha Rao—formed a minority government; Rao became the first PM of South Indian origin.
" After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, India was on the brink of bankruptcy, so, Rao took steps to liberalise the economy, and appointed Manmohan Singh—an economist and a former governor of the Reserve Bank of India—as finance minister."
" Rao and Singh then took various steps to liberalise the economy, these resulted in an unprecedented economic growth in India."
" His premiership, however, was also a witness to the demolition of the Babri Masjid, which resulted in the death of about 2,000 people."
" Rao, however, did complete five continuous years in office, becoming the first prime minister outside of the Nehru—Gandhi family to do so."
"After the end of Rao's tenure in May 1996, the nation saw four prime ministers in a span of three years, viz."
 Deve Gowda from 1 June 1996 to 21 April 1997; and one tenure of I.
 The government of Prime Minister Vajpayee—elected in 1998—took some concrete steps.
 In May 1998—after a month in power—the government announced the conduct of five underground nuclear explosions in Pokhran.
" In response to these tests, many western countries, including the United States, imposed economic sanctions on India, but, due to the support received from Russia, France, the Gulf countries and some other nations, the sanctions—were largely—not considered successful."
" A few months later in response to the Indian nuclear tests, Pakistan also conducted nuclear tests."
" Given the deteriorating situation between the two countries, the governments tried to improve bilateral relations."
" In February 1999, the India and Pakistan signed the Lahore Declaration, in which the two countries announced their intention to annul mutual enmity, increase trade and use their nuclear capabilities for peaceful purposes."
" In May 1999, All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam withdrew from the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) coalition; Vajpayee's government, hence, became a caretaker one after losing a motion-of-no-confidence 269–270, this coincided with the Kargil War with Pakistan."
" In the subsequent October 1999 general election, the BJP-led NDA and its affiliated parties secured a comfortable majority in the Lok Sabha, winning 299 of 543 seats in the lower house."
"Vajpayee continued the process of economic liberalisation during his reign, resulting in economic growth."
" In addition to the development of infrastructure and basic facilities, the government took several steps to improve the infrastructure of the country, such as, the National Highways Development Project (NHDP) and the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY; IAST: Pradhānamaṃtrī Grāma Saḍa़ka Yojanā; lit."
" Prime Minister Rural Road Scheme), for the development of roads."
" But during his reign, the 2002 Gujarat communal riots in the state of Gujarat took place; resulting in about 2,000 deaths."
" Vajpayee's tenure as prime minister came to an end in May 2004, making him the first non-Congress PM to complete a full five-year tenure."
"In the 2004 election, the Congress emerged as the largest party in a hung parliament; Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA)—with outside support from the Left Front, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) among others—proved a majority in the Lok Sabha, and Manmohan Singh was elected prime minister; becoming the first Sikh prime minister of the nation."
" During his tenure, the country retained the economic momentum gained during Prime Minister Vajpayee's tenure."
" Apart from this, the government succeeded in getting the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, and the Right to Information Act, 2005 passed in the parliament."
" Further, the government strengthened India's relations with nations like Afghanistan; Russia; the Gulf states; and the United States, culminating with the ratification of India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement near the end of Singh's first term."
" At the same time, the November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks also happened during Singh's first term in office."
" In the general election of 2009, the mandate of UPA increased."
" Prime Minister Singh's second term, however, was surrounded by accusations of high-level scandals and corruption."
" Singh resigned as prime minister on 17 May 2014, after Congress' defeat in the 2014 general election."
"In the general election of 2014, the BJP-led NDA got an absolute majority, winning 336 out of 543 Lok Sabha seats; the BJP itself became the first party since 1984 to get a majority in the Lok Sabha."
" Narendra Modi—the Chief Minister of Gujarat—was elected prime minister, becoming the first prime minister to have been born in an independent India."
Narendra Modi was re-elected as prime minister in 2019 with a bigger mandate than that of 2014.
 The BJP-led NDA winning 354 seats out of which BJP secured 303 seats.
"== Constitutional framework and position of prime minister ==
"
The Constitution envisions a scheme of affairs in which the president of India is the head of state; in terms of Article 53 with office of the prime minister being the head of Council of Ministers to assist and advise the president in the discharge of his/her constitutional functions.
"The executive powers of the Union shall be vested in the president and shall be exercised either directly or through subordinate officers, in accordance with the Constitution."
"There shall be a Council of Ministers with the Prime Minister at the head to aid and advise the president who shall, in the exercise of his functions, act in accordance with such advice."
The Prime Minister shall be appointed by the President and the other Ministers shall be appointed by the President on the advice of the Prime Minister.
"Like most parliamentary democracies, the president's duties are mostly ceremonial as long as the constitution and the rule of law is obeyed by the cabinet and the legislature."
 The prime minister of India is the head of government and has the responsibility for executive power.
" The president's constitutional duty is to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution and the law per article 60."
" In the constitution of India, the prime minister is mentioned in only four of its articles (articles 74, 75, 78 and 366), however he/she plays a crucial role in the government of India by enjoying majority in the Lok Sabha."
"According to Article 84 of the Constitution of India, which sets the principle qualification for member of Parliament, and Article 75 of the Constitution of India, which sets the qualifications for the minister in the Union Council of Ministers, and the argument that the position of prime minister has been described as primus inter pares (the first among equals), A prime minister must:
"
" If the person chosen as the prime minister is neither a member of the Lok Sabha nor the Rajya Sabha at the time of selection, they must become a member of either of the houses within six months."
"be above 25 years of age if they are a member of the Lok Sabha, or, above 30 years of age if they are a member of the Rajya Sabha."
not hold any office of profit under the government of India or the government of any state or under any local or other authority subject to the control of any of the said governments.
If however a candidate is elected as the prime minister they must vacate their post from any private or government company and may take up the post only on completion of their term.
"The prime minister is required to make and subscribe in the presence of the President of India before entering office, the oath of office and secrecy, as per the Third Schedule of the Constitution of India."
"I, <name>, do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the Constitution of India as by law established, that I will uphold the sovereignty and integrity of India, that I will faithfully and conscientiously discharge my duties as Prime Minister for the Union and that I will do right to all manner of people in accordance with the Constitution and the law, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will."
"I, <name>, do swear in the name of God/solemnly affirm that I will not directly or indirectly communicate or reveal to any person or persons any matter which shall be brought under my consideration or shall become known to me as Prime Minister for the Union except as may be required for the due discharge of my duties as such Minister."
"The prime minister serves on 'the pleasure of the president', hence, a prime minister may remain in office indefinitely, so long as the president has confidence in him/her."
" However, a prime minister must have the confidence of Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Parliament of India."
"However, the term of a prime minister can end before the end of a Lok Sabha's term, if a simple majority of its members no longer have confidence in him/her, this is called a vote-of-no-confidence."
 Deve Gowda and Atal Bihari Vajpayee have been voted out from office this way.
" In addition, a prime minister can also resign from office; Morarji Desai was the first prime minister to resign while in office."
"Upon ceasing to possess the requisite qualifications to be a member of Parliament subject to the Representation of the People Act, 1951."
The prime minister leads the functioning and exercise of authority of the government of India.
 The president of India—subject to eligibility—invites a person who is commanding support of majority members of Lok Sabha to form the government of India—also known as the central government or Union government—at the national level and exercise its powers.
 In practice the prime minister nominates the members of their council of ministers to the president.
" They also work upon to decide a core group of ministers (known as the cabinet), as in charge of the important functions and ministries of the government of India."
"The prime minister is responsible for aiding and advising the president in distribution of work of the government to various ministries and offices and in terms of the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961."
 The co-ordinating work is generally allocated to the Cabinet Secretariat.
" While the work of the government is generally divided into various Ministries, the prime minister may retain certain portfolios if they are not allocated to any member of the cabinet."
The prime minister—in consultation with the cabinet—schedules and attends the sessions of the houses of parliament and is required to answer the question from the Members of Parliament to them as the in-charge of the portfolios in the capacity as prime minister of India.
Some specific ministries/department are not allocated to anyone in the cabinet but the prime minister themself.
"Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (as Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions)
"
"Nuclear Command AuthorityThe prime minister represents the country in various delegations, high level meetings and international organisations that require the attendance of the highest government office, and also addresses to the nation on various issues of national or other importance."
"Per Article 78 of the constitution, the official communication between the union cabinet and the president are through the prime minister."
 Other wise constitution recognises the prime minister as a member of the union cabinet only outside the sphere of union cabinet.
"The prime minister recommends to the president—among others—names for the appointment of:
"
"Chief Election Commissioner of India (CEC) and other Election Commissioners of India (ECs)
"
"Chairperson and members of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)
"
"Chief Information Commissioner of India (CIC) and Information Commissioners of India
"
"Attorney General of India (AG) and Solicitor General of India (SG)As the chairperson of Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), the prime minister—on the non-binding advice of the Cabinet Secretary of India led-Senior Selection Board (SSB)—decides the postings of top civil servants, such as, secretaries, additional secretaries and joint secretaries in the government of India."
" Further, in the same capacity, the PM decides the assignments of top military personnel such as the Chief of the Army Staff, Chief of the Air Staff, Chief of the Naval Staff and commanders of operational and training commands."
" In addition, the ACC also decides the posting of Indian Police Service officers—the All India Service for policing, which staffs most of the higher level law enforcement positions at federal and state level—in the government of India."
"Also, as the Minister of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, the PM also exercises control over the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), the country's premier civil service, which staffs most of the senior civil service positions; the Public Enterprises Selection Board (PESB); and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), except for the selection of its director, who is chosen by a committee of: (a) the prime minister, as chairperson; (b) the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha; and (c) the chief justice."
"Unlike most other countries, the prime minister does not have much influence over the selection of judges, that is done by a collegium of judges consisting of the Chief Justice of India, four senior most judges of the Supreme Court of India and the chief justice—or the senior-most judge—of the concerned state high court."
" The executive as a whole, however, has the right to send back a recommended name to the collegium for reconsideration, this, however, is not a full Veto power, and the collegium can still put forward rejected name."
The prime minister acts as the leader of the house of the chamber of parliament—generally the Lok Sabha—he/she belongs to.
" In this role, the prime minister is tasked with representing the executive in the legislature, he/she is also expected to announce important legislation, and is further expected to respond to the opposition's concerns."
" Article 85 of the Indian constitution confers the president with the power to convene and end extraordinary sessions of the parliament, this power, however, is exercised only on the advise of the prime minister and his/her council, so, in practice, the prime minister does exercise some control over affairs of the parliament."
Article 75 of the Constitution of India confers the parliament with the power to decide the remuneration and other benefits of the prime minister and other ministers are to be decided by the Parliament.
