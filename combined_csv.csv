" Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's physical health.",sports
" Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals.",sports
" In certain sports such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other.",sports
" Some sports allow a ""tie"" or ""draw"", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner and one loser.",sports
 A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a champion.,sports
" Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.",sports
"Sport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions such as the Olympic Games admitting only sports meeting this definition.",sports
" Other organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without a physical element from classification as sports.",sports
" However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports.",sports
" The International Olympic Committee (through ARISF) recognises both chess and bridge as bona fide sports, and SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: bridge, chess, draughts (checkers), Go and xiangqi, and limits the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports.",sports
"Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow consistent adjudication of the winner.",sports
 Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first.,sports
" It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.",sports
"Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news.",sports
" Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting.",sports

" ""children taking part in sport""), with ""sports"" used to describe multiple activities (e.",sports
" ""football and rugby are the most popular sports in England"").",sports
The precise definition of what separates a sport from other leisure activities varies between sources.,sports
" The closest to an international agreement on a definition is provided by SportAccord, which is the association for all the largest international sports federations (including association football, athletics, cycling, tennis, equestrian sports, and more), and is therefore the de facto representative of international sport.",sports
"SportAccord uses the following criteria, determining that a sport should:
",sports
"not rely on equipment provided by a single supplier (excluding proprietary games such as arena football)
",sports
"not rely on any ""luck"" element specifically designed into the sport.",sports
"They also recognise that sport can be primarily physical (such as rugby or athletics), primarily mind (such as chess or Go), predominantly motorised (such as Formula 1 or powerboating), primarily co-ordination (such as billiard sports), or primarily animal-supported (such as equestrian sport).",sports
"The inclusion of mind sports within sport definitions has not been universally accepted, leading to legal challenges from governing bodies in regards to being denied funding available to sports.",sports
" Whilst SportAccord recognises a small number of mind sports, it is not open to admitting any further mind sports.",sports
"There has been an increase in the application of the term ""sport"" to a wider set of non-physical challenges such as video games, also called esports (from ""electronic sports""), especially due to the large scale of participation and organised competition, but these are not widely recognised by mainstream sports organisations.",sports
" According to Council of Europe, European Sports Charter, article 2.",sports
"i, ""'Sport' means all forms of physical activity which, through casual or organised participation, aim at expressing or improving physical fitness and mental well-being, forming social relationships or obtaining results in competition at all levels.",sports
"There are opposing views on the necessity of competition as a defining element of a sport, with almost all professional sports involving competition, and governing bodies requiring competition as a prerequisite of recognition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) or SportAccord.",sports
Other bodies advocate widening the definition of sport to include all physical activity.,sports
" For instance, the Council of Europe include all forms of physical exercise, including those competed just for fun.",sports
"In order to widen participation, and reduce the impact of losing on less able participants, there has been an introduction of non-competitive physical activity to traditionally competitive events such as school sports days, although moves like this are often controversial.",sports
"In competitive events, participants are graded or classified based on their ""result"" and often divided into groups of comparable performance, (e.",sports
" The measurement of the result may be objective or subjective, and corrected with ""handicaps"" or penalties.",sports
" In a race, for example, the time to complete the course is an objective measurement.",sports
" In gymnastics or diving the result is decided by a panel of judges, and therefore subjective.",sports
" There are many shades of judging between boxing and mixed martial arts, where victory is assigned by judges if neither competitor has lost at the end of the match time.",sports

" is not winning but taking part"" are typical expressions of this sentiment.",sports
"Key principles of sport include that the result should not be predetermined, and that both sides should have equal opportunity to win.",sports
" Rules are in place to ensure fair play, but participants can break these rules in order to gain advantage.",sports
"Participants may cheat in order to unfairly increase their chance of winning, or in order to achieve other advantages such as financial gains.",sports
" The widespread existence of gambling on the results of sports fixtures creates a motivation for match fixing, where a participant or participants deliberately work to ensure a given outcome rather than simply playing to win.",sports
"The competitive nature of sport encourages some participants to attempt to enhance their performance through the use of medicines, or through other means such as increasing the volume of blood in their bodies through artificial means.",sports

" However, not all disabled sports are adapted; several sports that have been specifically created for persons with a disability have no equivalent in able-bodied sports.",sports
"The competition element of sport, along with the aesthetic appeal of some sports, result in the popularity of people attending to watch sport being played.",sports
 This has led to the specific phenomenon of spectator sport.,sports

"Sport can be undertaken on an amateur, professional or semi-professional basis, depending on whether participants are incentivised for participation (usually through payment of a wage or salary).",sports
" Amateur participation in sport at lower levels is often called ""grassroots sport"".",sports
"The popularity of spectator sport as a recreation for non-participants has led to sport becoming a major business in its own right, and this has incentivised a high paying professional sport culture, where high performing participants are rewarded with pay far in excess of average wages, which can run into millions of dollars.",sports
"Some sports, or individual competitions within a sport, retain a policy of allowing only amateur sport.",sports
 The Olympic Games started with a principle of amateur competition with those who practised a sport professionally considered to have an unfair advantage over those who practised it merely as a hobby.,sports
" From 1971, Olympic athletes were allowed to receive compensation and sponsorship, and from 1986, the IOC decided to make all professional athletes eligible for the Olympics, with the exceptions of boxing, and wrestling.",sports

" Sports engineering emerged as a discipline in 1998 with an increasing focus not just on materials design but also the use of technology in sport, from analytics and big data to wearable technology.",sports
" In order to control the impact of technology on fair play, governing bodies frequently have specific rules that are set to control the impact of technical advantage between participants.",sports
" For example, in 2010, full-body, non-textile swimsuits were banned by FINA, as they were enhancing swimmers' performances.",sports
"The increase in technology has also allowed many decisions in sports matches to be taken, or reviewed, off-field, with another official using instant replays to make decisions.",sports
" In some sports, players can now challenge decisions made by officials.",sports
" In Association football, goal-line technology makes decisions on whether a ball has crossed the goal line or not.",sports

" This ban, also known as Rule 42, is still enforced, but was modified to allow football and rugby to be played in Croke Park while Lansdowne Road was redeveloped into Aviva Stadium.",sports
" Until recently, under Rule 21, the GAA also banned members of the British security forces and members of the RUC from playing Gaelic games, but the advent of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998 led to the eventual removal of the ban.",sports
"Nationalism is often evident in the pursuit of sport, or in its reporting: people compete in national teams, or commentators and audiences can adopt a partisan view.",sports
" On occasion, such tensions can lead to violent confrontation among players or spectators within and beyond the sporting venue, as in the Football War.",sports
 These trends are seen by many as contrary to the fundamental ethos of sport being carried on for its own sake and for the enjoyment of its participants.,sports

" A loss had the opposite effect, and the effect is greater for higher-profile teams or unexpected wins and losses.",sports
" Also, when Washington Redskins win their final game before an election, then the incumbent President is more likely to win, and if the Redskins lose, then the opposition candidate is more likely to win; this has become known as the Redskins Rule.",sports
"Étienne de La Boétie, in his essay Discourse on Voluntary Servitude describes athletic spectacles as means for tyrants to control their subjects by distracting them.",sports
"Do not imagine that there is any bird more easily caught by decoy, nor any fish sooner fixed on the hook by wormy bait, than are all these poor fools neatly tricked into servitude by the slightest feather passed, so to speak, before their mouths.",sports
 Truly it is a marvellous thing that they let themselves be caught so quickly at the slightest tickling of their fancy.,sports
" Plays, farces, spectacles, gladiators, strange beasts, medals, pictures, and other such opiates, these were for ancient peoples the bait toward slavery, the price of their liberty, the instruments of tyranny.",sports
" By these practices and enticements the ancient dictators so successfully lulled their subjects under the yoke, that the stupefied peoples, fascinated by the pastimes and vain pleasures flashed before their eyes, learned subservience as naïvely, but not so creditably, as little children learn to read by looking at bright picture books.",sports
Sport was an important form of worship in Ancient Greek religion.,sports
" The ancient Olympic Games, called the Olympiad, were held in honour of the head deity, Zeus, and featured various forms of religious dedication to him and other gods.",sports
" As many Greeks travelled to see the games, this combination of religion and sport also served as a way of uniting them.",sports
"The practice of athletic competitions has been criticised by some Christian thinkers as a form of idolatry, in which ""human beings extol themselves, adore themselves, sacrifice themselves and reward themselves.",sports
""" Sports are seen by these critics as a manifestation of ""collective pride"" and ""national self-deification"" in which feats of human power are idolized at the expense of divine worship.",sports
"Tertullian condemns the athletic performances of his day, insisting ""the entire apparatus of the shows is based upon idolatry.",sports
""" The shows, says Tertullian, excite passions foreign to the calm temperament cultivated by the Christian:
",sports
"God has enjoined us to deal calmly, gently, quietly, and peacefully with the Holy Spirit, because these things are alone in keeping with the goodness of His nature, with His tenderness and sensitiveness.",sports
" Well, how shall this be made to accord with the shows? For the show always leads to spiritual agitation, since where there is pleasure, there is keenness of feeling giving pleasure its zest; and where there is keenness of feeling, there is rivalry giving in turn its zest to that.",sports
" Then, too, where you have rivalry, you have rage, bitterness, wrath and grief, with all bad things which flow from them – the whole entirely out of keeping with the religion of Christ.",sports

"The Meaning of Sports by Michael Mandel (PublicAffairs, ISBN 1-58648-252-1).",sports
"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.",sports
" The batting side scores runs by striking the ball bowled at the wicket with the bat (and running between the wickets), while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter (so they are ""out"").",sports
" Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat and before it hits the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.",sports
" When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles.",sports
" The game is adjudicated by two umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.",sports
"Forms of cricket range from Twenty20, with each team batting for a single innings of 20 overs, to Test matches played over five days.",sports
" Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket they wear club or team colours.",sports
" In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised sewn seam enclosing a cork core layered with tightly wound string.",sports
The earliest reference to cricket is in South East England in the mid-16th century.,sports
" It spread globally with the expansion of the British Empire, with the first international matches in the second half of the 19th century.",sports
" The game's governing body is the International Cricket Council (ICC), which has over 100 members, twelve of which are full members who play Test matches.",sports
" The game's rules, the Laws of Cricket, are maintained by Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.",sports
" The sport is followed primarily in the Indian subcontinent, Australasia, the United Kingdom, southern Africa and the West Indies.",sports
" Women's cricket, which is organised and played separately, has also achieved international standard.",sports
" The most successful side playing international cricket is Australia, which has won seven One Day International trophies, including five World Cups, more than any other country and has been the top-rated Test side more than any other country.",sports
"Cricket is one of many games in the ""club ball"" sphere that basically involve hitting a ball with a hand-held implement; others include baseball (which shares many similarities with cricket, both belonging in the more specific bat-and-ball games category), golf, hockey, tennis, squash, badminton and table tennis.",sports
" In cricket's case, a key difference is the existence of a solid target structure, the wicket (originally, it is thought, a ""wicket gate"" through which sheep were herded), that the batsman must defend.",sports
" The cricket historian Harry Altham identified three ""groups"" of ""club ball"" games: the ""hockey group"", in which the ball is driven to and fro between two targets (the goals); the ""golf group"", in which the ball is driven towards an undefended target (the hole); and the ""cricket group"", in which ""the ball is aimed at a mark (the wicket) and driven away from it"".",sports
"It is generally believed that cricket originated as a children's game in the south-eastern counties of England, sometime during the medieval period.",sports
" Although there are claims for prior dates, the earliest definite reference to cricket being played comes from evidence given at a court case in Guildford on Monday, 17 January 1597 (Julian calendar; equating to 30 January 1598 in the Gregorian calendar).",sports
" The case concerned ownership of a certain plot of land and the court heard the testimony of a 59-year-old coroner, John Derrick, who gave witness that:
",sports
Being a scholler in the ffree schoole of Guldeford hee and diverse of his fellows did runne and play there at creckett and other plaies.,sports
"Given Derrick's age, it was about half a century earlier when he was at school and so it is certain that cricket was being played c.",sports
" The view that it was originally a children's game is reinforced by Randle Cotgrave's 1611 English-French dictionary in which he defined the noun ""crosse"" as ""the crooked staff wherewith boys play at cricket"" and the verb form ""crosser"" as ""to play at cricket"".",sports
"One possible source for the sport's name is the Old English word ""cryce"" (or ""cricc"") meaning a crutch or staff.",sports
" In Samuel Johnson's Dictionary, he derived cricket from ""cryce, Saxon, a stick"".",sports
" In Old French, the word ""criquet"" seems to have meant a kind of club or stick.",sports
" Given the strong medieval trade connections between south-east England and the County of Flanders when the latter belonged to the Duchy of Burgundy, the name may have been derived from the Middle Dutch (in use in Flanders at the time) ""krick""(-e), meaning a stick (crook).",sports
" Another possible source is the Middle Dutch word ""krickstoel"", meaning a long low stool used for kneeling in church and which resembled the long low wicket with two stumps used in early cricket.",sports
" According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of Bonn University, ""cricket"" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for hockey, met de (krik ket)sen (i.",sports
 Gillmeister has suggested that not only the name but also the sport itself may be of Flemish origin.,sports
"=== Growth of amateur and professional cricket in England ===
",sports
"Although the main object of the game has always been to score the most runs, the early form of cricket differed from the modern game in certain key technical aspects; the North American variant of cricket known as wicket retained many of these aspects.",sports
" The ball was bowled underarm by the bowler and along the ground towards a batsman armed with a bat that, in shape, resembled a hockey stick; the batsman defended a low, two-stump wicket; and runs were called notches because the scorers recorded them by notching tally sticks.",sports
"In 1611, the year Cotgrave's dictionary was published, ecclesiastical court records at Sidlesham in Sussex state that two parishioners, Bartholomew Wyatt and Richard Latter, failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket.",sports
" This is the earliest mention of adult participation in cricket and it was around the same time that the earliest known organised inter-parish or village match was played – at Chevening, Kent.",sports
" In 1624, a player called Jasper Vinall died after he was accidentally struck on the head during a match between two parish teams in Sussex.",sports
Cricket remained a low-key local pursuit for much of the 17th century.,sports
" It is known, through numerous references found in the records of ecclesiastical court cases, to have been proscribed at times by the Puritans before and during the Commonwealth.",sports
" The problem was nearly always the issue of Sunday play as the Puritans considered cricket to be ""profane"" if played on the Sabbath, especially if large crowds or gambling were involved.",sports
"According to the social historian Derek Birley, there was a ""great upsurge of sport after the Restoration"" in 1660.",sports
" Gambling on sport became a problem significant enough for Parliament to pass the 1664 Gambling Act, limiting stakes to £100 which was, in any case, a colossal sum exceeding the annual income of 99% of the population.",sports
" Along with prizefighting, horse racing and blood sports, cricket was perceived to be a gambling sport.",sports
" Rich patrons made matches for high stakes, forming teams in which they engaged the first professional players.",sports
" By the end of the century, cricket had developed into a major sport that was spreading throughout England and was already being taken abroad by English mariners and colonisers – the earliest reference to cricket overseas is dated 1676.",sports
" A 1697 newspaper report survives of ""a great cricket match"" played in Sussex ""for fifty guineas apiece"" – this is the earliest known contest that is generally considered a First Class match.",sports
"The patrons, and other players from the social class known as the ""gentry"", began to classify themselves as ""amateurs"" to establish a clear distinction from the professionals, who were invariably members of the working class, even to the point of having separate changing and dining facilities.",sports
" The gentry, including such high-ranking nobles as the Dukes of Richmond, exerted their honour code of noblesse oblige to claim rights of leadership in any sporting contests they took part in, especially as it was necessary for them to play alongside their ""social inferiors"" if they were to win their bets.",sports
" In time, a perception took hold that the typical amateur who played in first-class cricket, until 1962 when amateurism was abolished, was someone with a public school education who had then gone to one of Cambridge or Oxford University – society insisted that such people were ""officers and gentlemen"" whose destiny was to provide leadership.",sports
" In a purely financial sense, the cricketing amateur would theoretically claim expenses for playing while his professional counterpart played under contract and was paid a wage or match fee; in practice, many amateurs claimed more than actual expenditure and the derisive term ""shamateur"" was coined to describe the practice.",sports
The game underwent major development in the 18th century to become England's national sport.,sports
 Its success was underwritten by the twin necessities of patronage and betting.,sports
" Cricket was prominent in London as early as 1707 and, in the middle years of the century, large crowds flocked to matches on the Artillery Ground in Finsbury.",sports
" The single wicket form of the sport attracted huge crowds and wagers to match, its popularity peaking in the 1748 season.",sports
 Bowling underwent an evolution around 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball instead of rolling or skimming it towards the batsman.,sports
" This caused a revolution in bat design because, to deal with the bouncing ball, it was necessary to introduce the modern straight bat in place of the old ""hockey stick"" shape.",sports
"The Hambledon Club was founded in the 1760s and, for the next twenty years until the formation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) and the opening of Lord's Old Ground in 1787, Hambledon was both the game's greatest club and its focal point.",sports
 MCC quickly became the sport's premier club and the custodian of the Laws of Cricket.,sports
 New Laws introduced in the latter part of the 18th century included the three stump wicket and leg before wicket (lbw).,sports
The 19th century saw underarm bowling superseded by first roundarm and then overarm bowling.,sports
" Organisation of the game at county level led to the creation of the county clubs, starting with Sussex in 1839.",sports
" In December 1889, the eight leading county clubs formed the official County Championship, which began in 1890.",sports
" Grace, who started his long and influential career in 1865.",sports
" It was especially during the career of Grace that the distinction between amateurs and professionals became blurred by the existence of players like him who were nominally amateur but, in terms of their financial gain, de facto professional.",sports
 Grace himself was said to have been paid more money for playing cricket than any professional.,sports
"The last two decades before the First World War have been called the ""Golden Age of cricket"".",sports
" It is a nostalgic name prompted by the collective sense of loss resulting from the war, but the period did produce some great players and memorable matches, especially as organised competition at county and Test level developed.",sports
"Meanwhile, the British Empire had been instrumental in spreading the game overseas and by the middle of the 19th century it had become well established in Australia, the Caribbean, India, New Zealand, North America and South Africa.",sports
" In 1844, the first-ever international match took place between the United States and Canada.",sports

" The rivalry between England and Australia gave birth to The Ashes in 1882, and this has remained Test cricket's most famous contest.",sports
 Test cricket began to expand in 1888–89 when South Africa played England.,sports
"The inter-war years were dominated by Australia's Don Bradman, statistically the greatest Test batsman of all time.",sports
" Test cricket continued to expand during the 20th century with the addition of the West Indies (1928), New Zealand (1930) and India (1932) before the Second World War and then Pakistan (1952), Sri Lanka (1982), Zimbabwe (1992), Bangladesh (2000), Ireland and Afghanistan (both 2018) in the post-war period.",sports
 South Africa was banned from international cricket from 1970 to 1992 as part of the apartheid boycott.,sports
Cricket entered a new era in 1963 when English counties introduced the limited overs variant.,sports
" As it was sure to produce a result, limited overs cricket was lucrative and the number of matches increased.",sports
" The first Limited Overs International was played in 1971 and the governing International Cricket Council (ICC), seeing its potential, staged the first limited overs Cricket World Cup in 1975.",sports
" In the 21st century, a new limited overs form, Twenty20, made an immediate impact.",sports
" On 22 June 2017, Afghanistan and Ireland became the 11th and 12th ICC full members, enabling them to play Test cricket.",sports
"In cricket, the rules of the game are specified in a code called The Laws of Cricket (hereinafter called ""the Laws"") which has a global remit.",sports
" The earliest known version of the code was drafted in 1744 and, since 1788, it has been owned and maintained by its custodian, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London.",sports
"Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field (see image, right) between two teams of eleven players each.",sports
" The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is marked by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of these; the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.",sports
"In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden target called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.",sports
"0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting).",sports
 Each wicket is made of three wooden stumps topped by two bails.,sports
"As illustrated above, the pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and two return creases.",sports
" The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet eight inches long.",sports
" The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), it is, in fact, unlimited in length.",sports
" The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length.",sports
"Before a match begins, the team captains (who are also players) toss a coin to decide which team will bat first and so take the first innings.",sports
 Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the match.,sports
" In each innings, one team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other team bowls and fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen.",sports
" When the first innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match.",sports
 A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled innings is usually completed in a single day.,sports
" During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given time.",sports
" The exception to this is if a batsman has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her ability to run, in this case the batsman is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the batsman hits a scoring run or runs, though this does not apply in international cricket.",sports
" The order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.",sports
"The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but, in some forms of cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batsmen in their final innings in order to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn.",sports
" If the team batting last is all out having scored fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have ""lost by n runs"" (where n is the difference between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams).",sports
" If the team that bats last scores enough runs to win, it is said to have ""won by n wickets"", where n is the number of wickets left to fall.",sports
" For example, a team that passes its opponents' total having lost six wickets (i.",sports
", six of their batsmen have been dismissed) have won the match ""by four wickets"".",sports
"In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the other side's first innings total.",sports
" The team with the greater score is then said to have ""won by an innings and n runs"", and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams' aggregate scores.",sports
" If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62 happening in first-class matches from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017.",sports
" In the traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win, then the game is declared a draw.",sports
"If the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of overs applies to each innings.",sports
" Such a match is called a ""limited overs"" or ""one-day"" match, and the side scoring more runs wins regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur.",sports
" If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather, then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method after its developers, is often used to recalculate a new target score.",sports
" A one-day match can also be declared a ""no-result"" if fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.",sports
"In all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to continue.",sports
" There have been instances of entire matches, even Test matches scheduled to be played over five days, being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled: for example, the third Test of the 1970/71 series in Australia.",sports
The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play during a match.,sports
" Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings.",sports
" Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings can end before they have all done so.",sports
" The innings terminates if the batting team is ""all out"", a term defined by the Laws: ""at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman, further balls remain to be bowled but no further batsman is available to come in"".",sports
" In this situation, one of the batsmen has not been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because he has no partners left and there must always be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress.",sports
"An innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen:
",sports
"the batting team's captain may declare the innings closed even though some of his players have not had a turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his team have scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings
",sports
"the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time
",sports
"in the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game.",sports
"The Laws state that, throughout an innings, ""the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs of 6 balls"".",sports
" The name ""over"" came about because the umpire calls ""Over!"" when six balls have been bowled.",sports
" At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends while the batsmen do not.",sports
" A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a ""spell"".",sports
" The batsmen do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and vice versa.",sports
" The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at ""square leg"" now stands behind the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa.",sports
"The wicket-keeper (a specialized fielder behind the batsman) and the batsmen wear protective gear because of the hardness of the ball, which can be delivered at speeds of more than 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and presents a major health and safety concern.",sports
" Protective clothing includes pads (designed to protect the knees and shins), batting gloves or wicket-keeper's gloves for the hands, a safety helmet for the head and a box for male players inside the trousers (to protect the crotch area).",sports
" Some batsmen wear additional padding inside their shirts and trousers such as thigh pads, arm pads, rib protectors and shoulder pads.",sports
 The only fielders allowed to wear protective gear are those in positions very close to the batsman (i.,sports
", if they are alongside or in front of him), but they cannot wear gloves or external leg guards.",sports
"Subject to certain variations, on-field clothing generally includes a collared shirt with short or long sleeves; long trousers; woolen pullover (if needed); cricket cap (for fielding) or a safety helmet; and spiked shoes or boots to increase traction.",sports
" The kit is traditionally all white and this remains the case in Test and first-class cricket but, in limited overs cricket, team colours are worn instead.",sports
", bowls) the ball from his or her end of the pitch towards the batsman who, armed with a bat, is ""on strike"" at the other end (see next sub-section: Basic gameplay).",sports
"The bat is made of wood, usually salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a cylindrical handle.",sports
8 cm) wide and the total length of the bat not more than 38 inches (97 cm).,sports
" There is no standard for the weight, which is usually between 2 lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1.",sports
"The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 inches (23 cm).",sports
" The ball has a ""seam"": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior.",sports
 The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner.,sports
" During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable;  during the course of this deterioration, its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match.",sports
" Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties.",sports
" Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing through the air, but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam are illegal ball tampering.",sports
"During normal play, thirteen players and two umpires are on the field.",sports
 Two of the players are batsmen and the rest are all eleven members of the fielding team.,sports
 The other nine players in the batting team are off the field in the pavilion.,sports
 The image with overlay below shows what is happening when a ball is being bowled and which of the personnel are on or close to the pitch.,sports
"In the photo, the two batsmen (3 & 8; wearing yellow) have taken position at each end of the pitch (6).",sports
" Three members of the fielding team (4, 10 & 11; wearing dark blue) are in shot.",sports
 One of the two umpires (1; wearing white hat) is stationed behind the wicket (2) at the bowler's (4) end of the pitch.,sports
" The bowler (4) is bowling the ball (5) from his end of the pitch to the batsman (8) at the other end who is called the ""striker"".",sports
" The other batsman (3) at the bowling end is called the ""non-striker"".",sports
" The wicket-keeper (10), who is a specialist, is positioned behind the striker's wicket (9) and behind him stands one of the fielders in a position called ""first slip"" (11).",sports
" While the bowler and the first slip are wearing conventional kit only, the two batsmen and the wicket-keeper are wearing protective gear including safety helmets, padded gloves and leg guards (pads).",sports
"While the umpire (1) in shot stands at the bowler's end of the pitch, his colleague stands in the outfield, usually in or near the fielding position called ""square leg"", so that he is in line with the popping crease (7) at the striker's end of the pitch.",sports
 The bowling crease (not numbered) is the one on which the wicket is located between the return creases (12).,sports
" The bowler (4) intends to hit the wicket (9) with the ball (5) or, at least, to prevent the striker (8) from scoring runs.",sports
" The striker (8) intends, by using his bat, to defend his wicket and, if possible, to hit the ball away from the pitch in order to score runs.",sports
"Some players are skilled in both batting and bowling, or as either or these as well as wicket-keeping, so are termed all-rounders.",sports
"  Bowlers are classified according to their style, generally as fast bowlers, seam bowlers or spinners.",sports
 Batsmen are classified according to whether they are right-handed or left-handed.,sports
"Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above.",sports
" The other eight are elsewhere on the field, their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler.",sports
" Fielders often change position between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or bowler.",sports
"If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him, but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.",sports
 The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.,sports
 The Laws of Cricket were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers.,sports
"Most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill as a bowler, although some are all-rounders and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally.",sports
 The specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively.,sports
" If the captain wants a bowler to ""change ends"", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is not immediate.",sports
"A bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a ""run-up"" and an over is deemed to have begun when the bowler starts his run-up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being ""in play"".",sports
" Fast bowlers, needing momentum, take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a couple of steps before bowling.",sports
" The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145 kilometres per hour (90 mph) and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman, who is forced to react very quickly.",sports
 Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the ball seam or swing (i.,sports
" This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his shot, for example, so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be ""caught behind"" by the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder.",sports
 At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman.,sports
" A spinner will often ""buy his wicket"" by ""tossing one up"" (in a slower, steeper parabolic path) to lure the batsman into making a poor shot.",sports
" The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often ""flighted"" or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be ""trapped"" into getting himself out.",sports
 In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration.,sports
There are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed: five relatively common and five extremely rare.,sports
" The common forms of dismissal are bowled, caught, leg before wicket (lbw), run out and stumped.",sports
" Rare methods are hit wicket, hit the ball twice, obstructing the field, handled the ball and timed out.",sports
" The Laws state that the fielding team, usually the bowler in practice, must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision.",sports
" If the batsman is out, the umpire raises a forefinger and says ""Out!""; otherwise, he will shake his head and say ""Not out"".",sports
" There is, effectively, an eleventh method of dismissal, retired out, which is not an on-field dismissal as such but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.",sports
"Batsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the team.",sports
" Substitute batsmen are generally not allowed, except in the case of concussion substitutes in international cricket.",sports
In order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance.,sports
" Standardly, this involves adopting a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the toes of the back foot.",sports
"A skilled batsman can use a wide array of ""shots"" or ""strokes"" in both defensive and attacking mode.",sports
 The idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade.,sports
" If the ball touches the side of the bat it is called an ""edge"".",sports
 The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the ball to go through to the wicketkeeper.,sports
" Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball with his bat.",sports
" Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply ""blocking"" the ball but directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run.",sports
" A wide variety of shots are played, the batsman's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction aimed: e.",sports
" the ""striker"") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball.",sports
" To register a run, both runners must touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry their bats as they run).",sports
 Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.,sports
"The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's progress, and this is communicated by calling: usually ""yes"", ""no"" or ""wait"".",sports
" More than one run can be scored from a single hit: hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such that it is usually difficult to run four or more.",sports
" To compensate for this, hits that reach the boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary.",sports
" Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the help of ""overthrows"" by a fielder returning the ball.",sports
" If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker, the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker.",sports
" Only the striker can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.",sports
"Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called ""sundries"" in Australia) due to errors made by the fielding side.",sports
" This is achieved in four ways: no-ball, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules; wide, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach; bye, an extra awarded if the batsman misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional way; leg bye, as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman's body, though not his bat.",sports
" If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because that ball (i.",sports
", delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to score more runs from this extra ball.",sports
"The captain is often the most experienced player in the team, certainly the most tactically astute, and can possess any of the main skillsets as a batsman, a bowler or a wicket-keeper.",sports
" Within the Laws, the captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match and ensuring that his players conduct themselves ""within the spirit and traditions of the game as well as within the Laws"".",sports
"The wicket-keeper (sometimes called simply the ""keeper"") is a specialist fielder subject to various rules within the Laws about his equipment and demeanour.",sports
 He is the only member of the fielding side who can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards.,sports
" Depending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist batsmen or specialist bowlers.",sports
" Generally, a team will include five or six specialist batsmen and four or five specialist bowlers, plus the wicket-keeper.",sports
"The game on the field is regulated by the two umpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at the bowler's end, the other in a position called ""square leg"" which is about 15–20 metres away from the batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard.",sports
 The umpires have several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.,sports
", not a no-ball or a wide); when a run is scored; whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must first appeal to the umpire, usually with the phrase ""How's that?"" or ""Owzat?""); when intervals start and end; and the suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game.",sports
" The umpires are authorised to interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp pitch or deterioration of the light.",sports
"Off the field in televised matches, there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain incidents with the aid of video evidence.",sports
 The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries.,sports
 These matches also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the game.,sports
"The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing each team.",sports
" The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right).",sports
" For example, the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs.",sports
" The scorers are required by the Laws to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant amounts of additional data relating to the game.",sports
" Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks and runs were originally called notches.",sports
" According to Rowland Bowen, the earliest known scorecard templates were introduced in 1776 by T.",sports
 It is believed that scorecards were printed and sold at Lord's for the first time in 1846.,sports
"Besides observing the Laws, cricketers must respect the ""Spirit of Cricket"", a concept encompassing sportsmanship, fair play and mutual respect.",sports
 This spirit has long been considered an integral part of the sport but is only nebulously defined.,sports
" Amidst concern that the spirit was weakening, in 2000 a Preamble was added to the Laws instructing all participants to play within the spirit of the game.",sports
" The Preamble was last updated in 2017, now opening with the line:
",sports
"""Cricket owes much of its appeal and enjoyment to the fact that it should be played not only
",sports
"according to the Laws, but also within the Spirit of Cricket"".",sports
"The Preamble is a short statement intended to emphasise the ""positive behaviours that make cricket an exciting game that encourages leadership, friendship, and teamwork.",sports
""" Its second line states that ""the major responsibility for ensuring fair play rests with the captains, but extends to all
",sports
"players, match officials and, especially in junior cricket, teachers, coaches and parents.",sports
 They are required under the Laws to intervene in case of dangerous or unfair play or in cases of unacceptable conduct by a player.,sports
"Previous versions of the Spirit identified actions that were deemed contrary (for example, appealing knowing that the batsman is not out) but all specifics are now covered in the Laws of Cricket, the relevant governing playing regulations and disciplinary codes, or left to the judgement of the umpires, captains, their clubs and governing bodies.",sports
 The terse expression of the Spirit of Cricket now avoids the diversity of cultural conventions that exist in the detail of sportsmanship – or its absence.,sports
 International development began at the start of the 20th century and the first Test Match was played between Australia and England in December 1934.,sports
" The following year, New Zealand women joined them, and in 2007 Netherlands women became the tenth women's Test nation when they made their debut against South Africa women.",sports
" In 1958, the International Women's Cricket Council was founded (it merged with the ICC in 2005).",sports
" In 1973, the first Cricket World Cup of any kind took place when a Women's World Cup was held in England.",sports
"  In 2005, the International Women's Cricket Council was merged with the International Cricket Council (ICC) to form one unified body to help manage and develop cricket.",sports
 The ICC Women's Rankings were launched on 1 October 2015 covering all three formats of women's cricket.,sports
" In October 2018 following the ICC's decision to award T20 International status to all members, the Women's rankings were split into separate ODI (for Full Members) and T20I lists.",sports
"The International Cricket Council (ICC), which has its headquarters in Dubai, is the global governing body of cricket.",sports
" It was founded as the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 by representatives from England, Australia and South Africa, renamed the International Cricket Conference in 1965 and took up its current name in 1989.",sports
" The ICC in 2017 has 105 member nations, twelve of which hold full membership and can play Test cricket.",sports
" The ICC is responsible for the organisation and governance of cricket's major international tournaments, notably the men's and women's versions of the Cricket World Cup.",sports
" It also appoints the umpires and referees that officiate at all sanctioned Test matches, Limited Overs Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals.",sports
"Each member nation has a national cricket board which regulates cricket matches played in its country, selects the national squad, and organises home and away tours for the national team.",sports
" In the West Indies, which for cricket purposes is a federation of nations, these matters are addressed by Cricket West Indies.",sports
"The table below lists the ICC full members and their national cricket boards:
",sports
"Cricket is a multi-faceted sport with multiple formats that can effectively be divided into first-class cricket, limited overs cricket and, historically, single wicket cricket.",sports
" The highest standard is Test cricket (always written with a capital ""T"") which is in effect the international version of first-class cricket and is restricted to teams representing the twelve countries that are full members of the ICC (see above).",sports
" Although the term ""Test match"" was not coined until much later, Test cricket is deemed to have begun with two matches between Australia and England in the 1876–77 Australian season; since 1882, most Test series between England and Australia have been played for a trophy known as The Ashes.",sports
" The term ""first-class"", in general usage, is applied to top-level domestic cricket.",sports
" Test matches are played over five days and first-class over three to four days; in all of these matches, the teams are allotted two innings each and the draw is a valid result.",sports
"Limited overs cricket is always scheduled for completion in a single day, and the teams are allotted one innings each.",sports
 There are two types: List A which normally allows fifty overs per team; and Twenty20 in which the teams have twenty overs each.,sports
 Both of the limited overs forms are played internationally as Limited Overs Internationals (LOI) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20I).,sports
 List A was introduced in England in the 1963 season as a knockout cup contested by the first-class county clubs.,sports
 The concept was gradually introduced to the other leading cricket countries and the first limited overs international was played in 1971.,sports
" In 1975, the first Cricket World Cup took place in England.",sports
" Twenty20 is a new variant of limited overs itself with the purpose being to complete the match within about three hours, usually in an evening session.",sports
" Limited overs matches cannot be drawn, although a tie is possible and an unfinished match is a ""no result"".",sports
Single wicket was popular in the 18th and 19th centuries and its matches were generally considered top-class.,sports
" In this form, although each team may have from one to six players, there is only one batsman in at a time and he must face every delivery bowled while his innings lasts.",sports
 Single wicket has rarely been played since limited overs cricket began.,sports
 Matches tended to have two innings per team like a full first-class one and they could end in a draw.,sports
Cricket is played at both the international and domestic level.,sports
" There is one major international championship per format, and top-level domestic competitions mirror the three main international formats.",sports
" There are now a number of T20 leagues, which have spawned a ""T20 freelancer"" phenomenon.",sports
"Most international matches are played as parts of 'tours', when one nation travels to another for a number of weeks or months, and plays a number of matches of various sorts against the host nation.",sports
" Sometimes a perpetual trophy is awarded to the winner of the Test series, the most famous of which is The Ashes.",sports
"The ICC also organises competitions that are for several countries at once, including the Cricket World Cup, ICC T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy.",sports
" A league competition for Test matches played as part of normal tours, the ICC World Test Championship, had been proposed several times, and its first instance began in 2019.",sports
" A league competition for ODIs, the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, began in August 2020.",sports
" The ICC maintains Test rankings, ODI rankings and T20 rankings systems for the countries which play these forms of cricket.",sports
"Competitions for member nations of the ICC with Associate status include the ICC Intercontinental Cup, for first-class cricket matches, and the World Cricket League for one-day matches, the final matches of which now also serve as the ICC World Cup Qualifier.",sports
First-class cricket in England is played for the most part by the 18 county clubs which contest the County Championship.,sports
 The concept of a champion county has existed since the 18th century but the official competition was not established until 1890.,sports
" The most successful club has been Yorkshire, who had won 32 official titles (plus one shared) as of 2019.",sports
Australia established its national first-class championship in 1892–93 when the Sheffield Shield was introduced.,sports
" In Australia, the first-class teams represent the various states.",sports
The other ICC full members have national championship trophies called the Ahmad Shah Abdali 4-day Tournament (Afghanistan); the National Cricket League (Bangladesh); the Ranji Trophy (India); the Inter-Provincial Championship (Ireland); the Plunket Shield (New Zealand); the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy (Pakistan); the Currie Cup (South Africa); the Premier Trophy (Sri Lanka); the Shell Shield (West Indies); and the Logan Cup (Zimbabwe).,sports
"The world's earliest known cricket match was a village cricket meeting in Kent which has been deduced from a 1640 court case recording a ""cricketing"" of ""the Weald and the Upland"" versus ""the Chalk Hill"" at Chevening ""about thirty years since"" (i.",sports
 Inter-parish contests became popular in the first half of the 17th century and continued to develop through the 18th with the first local leagues being founded in the second half of the 19th.,sports
"At the grassroots level, local club cricket is essentially an amateur pastime for those involved but still usually involves teams playing in competitions at weekends or in the evening.",sports
" Schools cricket, first known in southern England in the 17th century, has a similar scenario and both are widely played in the countries where cricket is popular.",sports
" Although there can be variations in game format, compared with professional cricket, the Laws are always observed and club/school matches are therefore formal and competitive events.",sports
 The sport has numerous informal variants such as French cricket.,sports
"Cricket has had a broad impact on popular culture, both in the Commonwealth of Nations and elsewhere.",sports
" It has, for example, influenced the lexicon of these nations, especially the English language, with various phrases such as ""that's not cricket"" (that's unfair), ""had a good innings"" (lived a long life) and ""sticky wicket"".",sports
" ""On a sticky wicket"" (aka ""sticky dog"" or ""glue pot"") is a metaphor used to describe a difficult circumstance.",sports

Cricket has close historical ties with Australian rules football and many players have competed at top levels in both sports.,sports
" In 1858, prominent Australian cricketer Tom Wills called for the formation of a ""foot-ball club"" with ""a code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during the off-season.",sports
" The Melbourne Football Club was founded the following year, and Wills and three other members codified the first laws of the game.",sports
"In England, a number of association football clubs owe their origins to cricketers who sought to play football as a means of keeping fit during the winter months.",sports
 Derby County was founded as a branch of the Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1884; Aston Villa (1874) and Everton (1876) were both founded by members of church cricket teams.,sports
" Sheffield United's Bramall Lane ground was, from 1854, the home of the Sheffield Cricket Club, and then of Yorkshire; it was not used for football until 1862 and was shared by Yorkshire and Sheffield United from 1889 to 1973.",sports
"In the late 19th century, a former cricketer, English-born Henry Chadwick of Brooklyn, New York, was credited with devising the baseball box score (which he adapted from the cricket scorecard) for reporting game events.",sports

"Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.",sports
"  Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used.",sports
 Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby union or rugby league); and Gaelic football.,sports
 These various forms of football share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.,sports
"There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.",sports
 Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century.,sports
 The expansion and cultural influence of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.,sports
"  By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing: Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.",sports
"  In 1888, The Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football competitions.",sports
" During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.",sports
"The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American football, Canadian football, Australian football, rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as Association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved primarily with the feet, and where handling is strictly limited.",sports
Two teams of usually between 11 and 18 players; some variations that have fewer players (five or more per team) are also popular.,sports
"Scoring goals or points by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.",sports
Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.,sports
"In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.",sports
" In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts.",sports
"There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word ""football"".",sports
"  It is widely assumed that the word ""football"" (or the phrase ""foot ball"") refers to the action of the foot kicking a ball.",sports
"  There is an alternative explanation, which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in medieval Europe, which were played on foot.",sports
"The Chinese competitive game cuju (蹴鞠) resembles modern association football (soccer), descriptions appear in a military manual dated to the second and third centuries BC.",sports
"  It existed during the Han dynasty and possibly the Qin dynasty, in the second and third centuries BC.",sports

" In kemari several people stand in a circle and kick a ball to each other, trying not to let the ball drop to the ground (much like keepie uppie).",sports
"The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some of which involved the use of the feet.",sports
" The Roman game harpastum is believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as ""ἐπίσκυρος"" (Episkyros) or ""φαινίνδα"" (phaininda), which is mentioned by a Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c.",sports

"There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games, played by indigenous peoples in many different parts of the world.",sports
" For example, in 1586, men from a ship commanded by an English explorer named John Davis, went ashore to play a form of football with Inuit (Eskimo) people in Greenland.",sports
" There are later accounts of an Inuit game played on ice, called Aqsaqtuk.",sports
" Each match began with two teams facing each other in parallel lines, before attempting to kick the ball through each other team's line and then at a goal.",sports
" In 1610, William Strachey, a colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called Pahsaheman.",sports
" Pasuckuakohowog, a game similar to modern-day association football played amongst Amerindians, was also reported as early as the 17th century.",sports
"Games played in Mesoamerica with rubber balls by indigenous peoples are also well-documented as existing since before this time, but these had more similarities to basketball or volleyball, and no links have been found between such games and modern football sports.",sports
" Northeastern American Indians, especially the Iroquois Confederation, played a game which made use of net racquets to throw and catch a small ball; however, although it is a ball-goal foot game, lacrosse (as its modern descendant is called) is likewise not usually classed as a form of ""football.",sports
"On the Australian continent several tribes of indigenous people played kicking and catching games with stuffed balls which have been generalised by historians as Marn Grook (Djab Wurrung for ""game ball"").",sports
" The earliest historical account is an anecdote from the 1878 book by Robert Brough-Smyth, The Aborigines of Victoria, in which a man called Richard Thomas is quoted as saying, in about 1841 in Victoria, Australia, that he had witnessed Aboriginal people playing the game: ""Mr Thomas describes how the foremost player will drop kick a ball made from the skin of a possum and how other players leap into the air in order to catch it.",sports
""" Some historians have theorised that Marn Grook was one of the origins of Australian rules football.",sports
"The Māori in New Zealand played a game called Ki-o-rahi consisting of teams of seven players play on a circular field divided into zones, and score points by touching the 'pou' (boundary markers) and hitting a central 'tupu' or target.",sports

"The Middle Ages saw a huge rise in popularity of annual Shrovetide football matches throughout Europe, particularly in England.",sports
" An early reference to a ball game played in Britain comes from the 9th century Historia Brittonum, which describes ""a party of boys .",sports
" References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, date from the 12th century.",sports
"The early forms of football played in England, sometimes referred to as ""mob football"", would be played in towns or between neighbouring villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams who would clash en masse, struggling to move an item, such as inflated animal's bladder to particular geographical points, such as their opponents' church, with play taking place in the open space between neighbouring parishes.",sports
" The game was played primarily during significant religious festivals, such as Shrovetide, Christmas, or Easter, and Shrovetide games have survived into the modern era in a number of English towns (see below).",sports
The first detailed description of what was almost certainly football in England was given by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183.,sports
" He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday:
",sports
After lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game.,sports
 The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls.,sports
" Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.",sports
"Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of ""ball play"" or ""playing at ball"".",sports
 This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.,sports
"An early reference to a ball game that was probably football comes from 1280 at Ulgham, Northumberland, England:  ""Henry.",sports
"  Football was played in Ireland in 1308, with a documented reference to John McCrocan, a spectator at a ""football game"" at Newcastle, County Down being charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard.",sports

"In 1314, Nicholas de Farndone, Lord Mayor of the City of London issued a decree banning football in the French used by the English upper classes at the time.",sports
" A translation reads: ""[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [rageries de grosses pelotes de pee] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future.",sports
"In 1363, King Edward III of England issued a proclamation banning "".",sports
"handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games"", showing that ""football"" – whatever its exact form in this case – was being differentiated from games involving other parts of the body, such as handball.",sports
"A game known as ""football"" was played in Scotland as early as the 15th century: it was prohibited by the Football Act 1424 and although the law fell into disuse it was not repealed until 1906.",sports
" There is evidence for schoolboys playing a ""football"" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball.",sports
" The word ""pass"" in the most recent translation is derived from ""huc percute"" (strike it here) and later ""repercute pilam"" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin.",sports
 It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team.,sports
" The original word translated as ""goal"" is ""metum"", literally meaning the ""pillar at each end of the circus course"" in a Roman chariot race.",sports
" There is a reference to ""get hold of the ball before [another player] does"" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed.",sports
" One sentence states in the original 1930 translation ""Throw yourself against him"" (Age, objice te illi).",sports
"King Henry IV of England also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word ""football"", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for ""foteball"".",sports
"There is also an account in Latin from the end of the 15th century of football being played at Caunton, Nottinghamshire.",sports
" This is the first description of a ""kicking game"" and the first description of dribbling: ""[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game.",sports
" It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet.",sports
" kicking in opposite directions"" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football pitch, stating that: ""[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.",sports
"""a football"", in the sense of a ball rather than a game, was first mentioned in 1486.",sports
 This reference is in Dame Juliana Berners' Book of St Albans.,sports
"it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal.",sports
a pair of football boots were ordered by King Henry VIII of England in 1526.,sports
"women playing a form of football was first described in 1580 by Sir Philip Sidney in one of his poems: ""[a] tyme there is for all, my mother often sayes, When she, with skirts tuckt very hy, with girles at football playes.",sports
the first references to goals are in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.,sports
" In 1584 and 1602 respectively, John Norden and Richard Carew referred to ""goals"" in Cornish hurling.",sports
" Carew described how goals were made: ""they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue [twelve] score off, other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales"".",sports
 He is also the first to describe goalkeepers and passing of the ball between players.,sports
"the first direct reference to scoring a goal is in John Day's play The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green (performed circa 1600; published 1659): ""I'll play a gole at camp-ball"" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in East Anglia).",sports
" Similarly in a poem in 1613, Michael Drayton refers to ""when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe"".",sports
"In the 16th century, the city of Florence celebrated the period between Epiphany and Lent by playing a game which today is known as ""calcio storico"" (""historic kickball"") in the Piazza Santa Croce.",sports
 The young aristocrats of the city would dress up in fine silk costumes and embroil themselves in a violent form of football.,sports
" For example, calcio players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents.",sports
 The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise.,sports
" In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino.",sports
 This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game.,sports
 The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).,sports
"There have been many attempts to ban football, from the middle ages through to the modern day.",sports
 The first such law was passed in England in 1314; it was followed by more than 30 in England alone between 1314 and 1667.,sports
" Women were banned from playing at English and Scottish Football League grounds in 1921, a ban that was only lifted in the 1970s.",sports
 Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.,sports
"  The game played in the 19th century resembled mob football that developed in medieval Europe, including a version popular on university campuses known as Old division football, and several municipalities banned its play in the mid-19th century.",sports
" By the 20th century, the game had evolved to a more rugby style game.",sports
"  In 1905, there were calls to ban American football in the U.",sports
 due to its violence; a meeting that year was hosted by American president Theodore Roosevelt led to sweeping rules changes that caused the sport to diverge significantly from its rugby roots to become more like the sport as it is played today.,sports
"While football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its public schools (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes.",sports
" First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its ""mob"" form and turning it into an organised team sport.",sports
" Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools.",sports
" Third, it was teachers, students, and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools.",sports
" Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between ""kicking"" and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games first became clear.",sports
"The earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools – mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes – comes from the Vulgaria by William Herman in 1519.",sports
" Herman had been headmaster at Eton and Winchester colleges and his Latin textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase ""We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde"".",sports
"Richard Mulcaster, a student at Eton College in the early 16th century and later headmaster at other English schools, has been described as ""the greatest sixteenth Century advocate of football"".",sports
 Among his contributions are the earliest evidence of organised team football.,sports
" Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (""sides"" and ""parties""), positions (""standings""), a referee (""judge over the parties"") and a coach ""(trayning maister)"".",sports
" Mulcaster's ""footeball"" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:
",sports
"[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously .",sports
" may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.",sports
"In 1633, David Wedderburn, a teacher from Aberdeen, mentioned elements of modern football games in a short Latin textbook called Vocabula.",sports
" Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as ""keeping goal"" and makes an allusion to passing the ball (""strike it here"").",sports
" There is a reference to ""get hold of the ball"", suggesting that some handling was allowed.",sports
" It is clear that the tackles allowed included the charging and holding of opposing players (""drive that man back"").",sports
"A more detailed description of football is given in Francis Willughby's Book of Games, written in about 1660.",sports
" Willughby, who had studied at Bishop Vesey's Grammar School, Sutton Coldfield, is the first to describe goals and a distinct playing field: ""a close that has a gate at either end.",sports
""" His book includes a diagram illustrating a football field.",sports
" He also mentions tactics (""leaving some of their best players to guard the goal""); scoring (""they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win"") and the way teams were selected (""the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"").",sports
" He is the first to describe a ""law"" of football: ""they must not strike [an opponent's leg] higher than the ball"".",sports
English public schools were the first to codify football games.,sports
" In particular, they devised the first offside rules, during the late 18th century.",sports
" In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were ""off their side"" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective.",sports
" Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand.",sports
" They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a scrum or similar formation.",sports
" However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, Rugby, Harrow and Cheltenham, during between 1810 and 1850.",sports
 The first known codes – in the sense of a set of rules – were those of Eton in 1815 and Aldenham in 1825.,sports
"During the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day.",sports
" They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many children were part of the labour force.",sports
" Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.",sports
Football was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit.,sports
" Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils.",sports
" Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, Marlborough and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, Westminster and Charterhouse).",sports
 The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played.,sports
" For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school cloisters, making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.",sports
"William Webb Ellis, a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have ""with a fine disregard for the rules of football, as played in his time [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game.",sports
" This act is usually said to be the beginning of Rugby football, but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal.",sports
" The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory, the rule for which Webb Ellis showed disregard was running forward with it as the rules of his time only allowed a player to retreat backwards or kick forwards.",sports
The boom in rail transport in Britain during the 1840s meant that people were able to travel further and with less inconvenience than they ever had before.,sports
" However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules.",sports
" The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host ""home"" school, and the other half by the visiting ""away"" school.",sports
The modern rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century.,sports
" This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc.",sports
 The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first lawnmower in 1830.,sports
" This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.",sports
"Apart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields.",sports
" However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see Surviving UK school games below).",sports
"Public schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the Factory Act of 1850, which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children.",sports
" Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day.",sports
" These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.",sports
"The earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:
",sports
 Old Salopians (played at Cambridge University the following year).,sports
"Sports clubs dedicated to playing football began in the 18th century, for example London's Gymnastic Society which was founded in the mid-18th century and ceased playing matches in 1796.",sports
"The first documented club to bear in the title a reference to being a 'football club' were called ""The Foot-Ball Club"" who were located in Edinburgh, Scotland, during the period 1824–41.",sports
  The club forbade tripping but allowed pushing and holding and the picking up of the ball.,sports
"In 1845, three boys at Rugby school were tasked with codifying the rules then being used at the school.",sports
 These were the first set of written rules (or code) for any form of football.,sports
"The earliest known matches involving non-public school clubs or institutions are as follows:
",sports
"One of the longest running football fixture is the Cordner-Eggleston Cup, contested between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College, Melbourne every year since 1858.",sports
" It is believed by many to also be the first match of Australian rules football, although it was played under experimental rules in its first year.",sports
" The first football trophy tournament was the Caledonian Challenge Cup, donated by the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne, played in 1861 under the Melbourne Rules.",sports
"  The oldest football league is a rugby football competition, the United Hospitals Challenge Cup (1874), while the oldest rugby trophy is the Yorkshire Cup, contested since 1878.",sports
 The South Australian Football Association (30 April 1877) is the oldest surviving Australian rules football competition.,sports
 The oldest surviving soccer trophy is the Youdan Cup (1867) and the oldest national football competition is the English FA Cup (1871).,sports
 The Football League (1888) is recognised as the longest running Association Football league.,sports
 The first ever international football match took place between sides representing England and Scotland on 5 March 1870 at the Oval under the authority of the FA.,sports
"In Europe, early footballs were made out of animal bladders, more specifically pig's bladders, which were inflated.",sports
 Later leather coverings were introduced to allow the balls to keep their shape.,sports
" However, in 1851, Richard Lindon and William Gilbert, both shoemakers from the town of Rugby (near the school), exhibited both round and oval-shaped balls at the Great Exhibition in London.",sports
 Richard Lindon's wife is said to have died of lung disease caused by blowing up pig's bladders.,sports
" Lindon also won medals for the invention of the ""Rubber inflatable Bladder"" and the ""Brass Hand Pump"".",sports
" inventor Charles Goodyear – who had patented vulcanised rubber – exhibited a spherical football, with an exterior of vulcanised rubber panels, at the Paris Exhibition Universelle.",sports
 The ball was to prove popular in early forms of football in the U.,sports
"The iconic ball with a regular pattern of hexagons and pentagons (see truncated icosahedron) did not become popular until the 1960s, and was first used in the World Cup in 1970.",sports
"The earliest reference to a game of football involving players passing the ball and attempting to score past a goalkeeper was written in 1633 by David Wedderburn, a poet and teacher in Aberdeen, Scotland.",sports
"  Nevertheless, the original text does not state whether the allusion to passing as 'kick the ball back' ('Repercute pilam') was in a forward or backward direction or between members of the same opposing teams (as was usual at this time)""Scientific"" football is first recorded in 1839 from Lancashire and in the modern game in Rugby football from 1862 and from Sheffield FC as early as 1865.",sports
"  The first side to play a passing combination game was the Royal Engineers AFC in 1869/70 By 1869 they were ""work[ing] well together"", ""backing up"" and benefiting from ""cooperation"".",sports
" Creswell, who having brought the ball up the side then kicked it into the middle to another of his side, who kicked it through the posts the minute before time was called"".",sports
" By early 1872 the Engineers were the first football team renowned for ""play[ing] beautifully together"".",sports
" A double pass is first reported from Derby school against Nottingham Forest in March 1872, the first of which is irrefutably a short pass: ""Mr Absey dribbling the ball half the length of the field delivered it to Wallis, who kicking it cleverly in front of the goal, sent it to the captain who drove it at once between the Nottingham posts"".",sports
" The first side to have perfected the modern formation was Cambridge University AFC and introduced the 2–3–5 ""pyramid"" formation.",sports
"During the nineteenth century, several codifications of the rules of football were made at the University of Cambridge, in order to enable students from different public schools to play each other.",sports
  The Cambridge Rules of 1863 influenced the decision of Football Association to ban Rugby-style carrying of the ball in its own first set of laws.,sports
"By the late 1850s, many football clubs had been formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various codes of football.",sports
" Sheffield Football Club, founded in 1857 in the English city of Sheffield by Nathaniel Creswick and William Prest, was later recognised as the world's oldest club playing association football.",sports
"However, the club initially played its own code of football: the Sheffield rules.",sports
" The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an offside rule.",sports
The code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football.,sports
" These included free kicks, corner kicks, handball, throw-ins and the crossbar.",sports
 By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England.,sports
 At this time a series of rule changes by both the London and Sheffield FAs gradually eroded the differences between the two games until the adoption of a common code in 1877.,sports
"There is archival evidence of ""foot-ball"" games being played in various parts of Australia throughout the first half of the 19th century.",sports
" The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in Melbourne, the capital city of Victoria.",sports
"In July 1858, Tom Wills, an Australian-born cricketer educated at Rugby School in England, wrote a letter to Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle, calling for a ""foot-ball club"" with a ""code of laws"" to keep cricketers fit during winter.",sports
 This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football.,sports
" Through publicity and personal contacts Wills was able to co-ordinate football matches in Melbourne that experimented with various rules, the first of which was played on 31 July 1858.",sports
" One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between Melbourne Grammar School and Scotch College.",sports
" Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.",sports
Wills and others involved in these early matches formed the Melbourne Football Club (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859.,sports
 Smith met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs.,sports
 The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various rugby football rules he learnt during his schooling.,sports
" The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions.",sports
" Harrison, a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted ""a game of our own"".",sports
" The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the mark, free kick, tackling, lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for throwing the ball.",sports
The Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs.,sports
 The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs.,sports
" Harrison's committee accommodated the Geelong Football Club's rules, making the game then known as ""Victorian Rules"" increasingly distinct from other codes.",sports
" It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured bouncing the ball while running and spectacular high marking.",sports
" Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in other parts of the world, and the Australian Football League emerged as the dominant professional competition.",sports
"During the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games.",sports
" Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at Uppingham School and he issued his own rules of what he called ""The Simplest Game"" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules).",sports
" In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.",sports
"At the Freemasons' Tavern, Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the London Metropolitan area met for the inaugural meeting of The Football Association (FA).",sports
 The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members.,sports
" Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association.",sports
" In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863.",sports
" After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published.",sports
" However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863.",sports
 The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and hacking (kicking opposing players in the shins).,sports
" A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.",sports
" If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.",sports
At the fifth meeting it was proposed that these two rules be removed.,sports
" Campbell, the representative from Blackheath and the first FA treasurer, objected.",sports
" However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA.",sports
" After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the ""Laws of Football"", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football.",sports
" The term ""soccer"", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an Oxford University abbreviation of ""Association"".",sports
"The first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a mark, which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a free kick at goal, from 15 yards (13.",sports
"In Britain, by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.",sports
" There were also ""rugby"" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.",sports
" However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU).",sports
" They also included the try, where touching the ball over the line allowed an attempt at goal, though drop-goals from marks and general play, and penalty conversions were still the main form of contest.",sports
"Rugby football split into Rugby union, Rugby league, American football, and Canadian football.",sports
 Tom Wills played Rugby football in England before founding Australian rules football.,sports
"As was the case in Britain, by the early 19th century, North American schools and universities played their own local games, between sides made up of students.",sports
" For example, students at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire played a game called Old division football, a variant of the association football codes, as early as the 1820s.",sports
" They remained largely ""mob football"" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary.",sports
 The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them.,sports
" Yale University, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard University followed suit in 1861.",sports
" In its place, two general types of football evolved: ""kicking"" games and ""running"" (or ""carrying"") games.",sports
" A hybrid of the two, known as the ""Boston game"", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club.",sports
" The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1862 by schoolboys who played the ""Boston game"" on Boston Common.",sports
 The game began to return to American college campuses by the late 1860s.,sports
" The universities of Yale, Princeton (then known as the College of New Jersey), Rutgers, and Brown all began playing ""kicking"" games during this time.",sports
" In 1867, Princeton used rules based on those of the English Football Association.",sports
"In Canada, the first documented football match was a practice game played on 9 November 1861, at University College, University of Toronto (approximately 400 yards west of Queen's Park).",sports
" One of the participants in the game involving University of Toronto students was (Sir) William Mulock, later Chancellor of the school.",sports
" Bethune, and Christopher Gwynn, one of the founders of Milton, Massachusetts, devised rules based on rugby football.",sports
" A ""running game"", resembling rugby football, was then taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868.",sports
"On 6 November 1869, Rutgers faced Princeton in a game that was played with a round ball and, like all early games, used improvised rules.",sports
 It is usually regarded as the first game of American intercollegiate football.,sports
Modern North American football grew out of a match between McGill University of Montreal and Harvard University in 1874.,sports
" During the game, the two teams alternated between the rugby-based rules used by McGill and the Boston Game rules used by Harvard.",sports
" Within a few years, Harvard had both adopted McGill's rules and persuaded other U.",sports
" On 23 November 1876, representatives from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia met at the Massasoit Convention in Springfield, Massachusetts, agreeing to adopt most of the Rugby Football Union rules, with some variations.",sports
"In 1880, Yale coach Walter Camp, who had become a fixture at the Massasoit House conventions where the rules were debated and changed, devised a number of major innovations.",sports
 Camp's two most important rule changes that diverged the American game from rugby were replacing the scrummage with the line of scrimmage and the establishment of the down-and-distance rules.,sports
 American football still however remained a violent sport where collisions often led to serious injuries and sometimes even death.,sports
" President Theodore Roosevelt to hold a meeting with football representatives from Harvard, Yale, and Princeton on 9 October 1905, urging them to make drastic changes.",sports
" One rule change introduced in 1906, devised to open up the game and reduce injury, was the introduction of the legal forward pass.",sports
" Though it was underutilised for years, this proved to be one of the most important rule changes in the establishment of the modern game.",sports
"Over the years, Canada absorbed some of the developments in American football in an effort to distinguish it from a more rugby-oriented game.",sports
" In 1903, the Ontario Rugby Football Union adopted the Burnside rules, which implemented the line of scrimmage and down-and-distance system from American football, among others.",sports
 Canadian football then implemented the legal forward pass in 1929.,sports
" American and Canadian football remain different codes, stemming from rule changes that the American side of the border adopted but the Canadian side has not.",sports
"In the mid-19th century, various traditional football games, referred to collectively as caid, remained popular in Ireland, especially in County Kerry.",sports
" Ferris, described two main forms of caid during this period: the ""field game"" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic ""cross-country game"" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary.",sports
" ""Wrestling"", ""holding"" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.",sports
"By the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland.",sports
" Trinity College Dublin was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the Developments in the 1850s section, above).",sports
" Traditional forms of caid had begun to give way to a ""rough-and-tumble game"" which allowed tripping.",sports
"There was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1884.",sports
" The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football.",sports
 The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by Maurice Davin and published in the United Ireland magazine on 7 February 1887.,sports
 Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football.,sports
" The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).",sports
"The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) was founded in 1886, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code.",sports
 Professionalism had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.,sports
"In England, by the 1890s, a long-standing Rugby Football Union ban on professional players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries.",sports
" This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England.",sports
" In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in Huddersfield to form the Northern Rugby Football Union (NRFU).",sports
 The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements.,sports
" However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.",sports
"The demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better ""spectator"" sport.",sports
" Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the line-out.",sports
" This was followed by the replacement of the ruck with the ""play-the-ball ruck"", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled.",sports
" Mauls were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck.",sports
" The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the first time the name rugby league was used officially in England.",sports
"Over time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as rugby union.",sports
"The need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures.",sports
" The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress.",sports
" It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association.",sports
 The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.,sports
" The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.",sports
"Rugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players.",sports
" In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional rugby leagues were launched in Australia the following year.",sports
" However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match.",sports
" This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in Bordeaux.",sports
"During the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further.",sports
" In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of downs: a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately).",sports
"  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the six tackle rule.",sports
"With the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10 metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.",sports
"The laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league.",sports
" In particular, goals from marks were abolished, kicks directly into touch from outside the 22 metre line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ruck or maul, and the lifting of players in line-outs was legalised.",sports
"In 1995, rugby union became an ""open"" game, that is one which allowed professional players.",sports
 Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared – and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification – the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.,sports
"The word football, when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above.",sports
" Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term football, primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the English-speaking world.",sports
" Most often, the word ""football"" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region (which is Association football in most countries).",sports
" So, effectively, what the word ""football"" means usually depends on where one says it.",sports
"In each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as ""football"", while the others generally require a qualifier.",sports
" In New Zealand, ""football"" historically referred to rugby union, but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football.",sports
" The sport meant by the word ""football"" in Australia is either Australian rules football or rugby league, depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the Barassi Line).",sports
" In francophone Quebec, where Canadian football is more popular, the Canadian code is known as le football while American football is known as le football américain and association football is known as le soccer.",sports
"Of the 45 national FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently use Football in their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates in Canada and the United States use Soccer in their names.",sports
" A few FIFA affiliates have recently ""normalised"" to using ""Football"", including:
",sports
"Australia's association football governing body changed its name in 2005 from using ""soccer"" to ""football""
",sports
"New Zealand's governing body renamed itself in 2007, saying ""the international game is called football.",sports
"Samoa changed from ""Samoa Football (Soccer) Federation"" to ""Football Federation Samoa"" in 2009.",sports
Several of the football codes are the most popular team sports in the world.,sports
" Globally, association football is played by over 250 million players in over 200 nations, and has the highest television audience in sport, making it the most popular in the world.",sports
"1 million high school football players and nearly 70,000 college football players, is the most popular sport in the United States, with the annual Super Bowl game accounting for nine of the top ten of the most watched broadcasts in U.",sports
" The NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world and has the highest revenue out of any single professional sports league.",sports
" Thus, the best association football and American football players are among the highest paid athletes in the world.",sports
Australian rules football has the highest spectator attendance of all sports in Australia.,sports
" Similarly, Gaelic football is the most popular sport in Ireland in terms of match attendance, and the All-Ireland Football Final is the most watched event of that nation's sporting year.",sports
"Rugby union is the most popular sport in New Zealand, Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji.",sports
 with college rugby being the fastest growing college sport in that country.,sports

4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.,sports
048 m) high to a backboard at each end of the court) while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.,sports
" A field goal is worth two points, unless made from behind the three-point line, when it is worth three.",sports
" After a foul, timed play stops and the player fouled or designated to shoot a technical foul is given one, two or three one-point free throws.",sports
" The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.",sports
"Players advance the ball by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling) or by passing it to a teammate, both of which require considerable skill.",sports
" On offense, players may use a variety of shots—the layup, the jump shot, or a dunk; on defense, they may steal the ball from a dribbler, intercept passes, or block shots; either offense or defense may collect a rebound, that is, a missed shot that bounces from rim or backboard.",sports
" It is a violation to lift or drag one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.",sports
The five players on each side fall into five playing positions.,sports
" The tallest player is usually the center, the second-tallest and strongest is the power forward, a slightly shorter but more agile player is the small forward, and the shortest players or the best ball handlers are the shooting guard and the point guard, who implements the coach's game plan by managing the execution of offensive and defensive plays (player positioning).",sports
" Informally, players may play three-on-three, two-on-two, and one-on-one.",sports
"Invented in 1891 by Canadian-American gym teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts, United States, basketball has evolved to become one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.",sports
" The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most significant professional basketball league in the world in terms of popularity, salaries, talent, and level of competition.",sports
" Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues qualify to continental championships such as the EuroLeague and the Basketball Champions League Americas.",sports

The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup and Women's Olympic Basketball Tournament feature top national teams from continental championships.,sports
" The main North American league is the WNBA (NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship is also popular), whereas the strongest European clubs participate in the EuroLeague Women.",sports
"In December 1891, James Naismith, a Canadian professor of physical education and instructor at the International Young Men's Christian Association Training School (now Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, was trying to keep his gym class active on a rainy day.",sports
 He sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters.,sports
" After rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he invented a new game in which players would pass a ball to teammates and try to score points by tossing the ball into a basket mounted on a wall.",sports
 Naismith wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto an elevated track.,sports
" Naismith initially set up the peach basket with its bottom intact, which meant that the ball had to be retrieved manually after each ""basket"" or point scored.",sports
" This quickly proved tedious, so Naismith removed the bottom of the basket to allow the balls to be poked out with a long dowel after each scored basket.",sports
" These round balls from ""association football"" were made, at the time, with a set of laces to close off the hole needed for inserting the inflatable bladder after the other sewn-together segments of the ball's cover had been flipped outside-in.",sports
 These laces could cause bounce passes and dribbling to be unpredictable.,sports
" Eventually a lace-free ball construction method was invented, and this change to the game was endorsed by Naismith.",sports
" (Whereas in American football, the lace construction proved to be advantageous for gripping and remains to this day.",sports
") The first balls made specifically for basketball were brown, and it was only in the late 1950s that Tony Hinkle, searching for a ball that would be more visible to players and spectators alike, introduced the orange ball that is now in common use.",sports
" Dribbling was not part of the original game except for the ""bounce pass"" to teammates.",sports
 Dribbling was eventually introduced but limited by the asymmetric shape of early balls.,sports
" Dribbling was common by 1896, with a rule against the double dribble by 1898.",sports
The peach baskets were used until 1906 when they were finally replaced by metal hoops with backboards.,sports
" A further change was soon made, so the ball merely passed through.",sports
" Whenever a person got the ball in the basket, his team would gain a point.",sports
" The baskets were originally nailed to the mezzanine balcony of the playing court, but this proved impractical when spectators in the balcony began to interfere with shots.",sports
 The backboard was introduced to prevent this interference; it had the additional effect of allowing rebound shots.,sports
" Naismith's handwritten diaries, discovered by his granddaughter in early 2006, indicate that he was nervous about the new game he had invented, which incorporated rules from a children's game called duck on a rock, as many had failed before it.",sports
"Frank Mahan, one of the players from the original first game, approached Naismith after the Christmas break, in early 1892, asking him what he intended to call his new game.",sports
 Naismith replied that he hadn't thought of it because he had been focused on just getting the game started.,sports
" Mahan suggested that it be called ""Naismith ball"", at which he laughed, saying that a name like that would kill any game.",sports
" Mahan then said, ""Why not call it basketball?"" Naismith replied, ""We have a basket and a ball, and it seems to me that would be a good name for it.",sports

"At the time, soccer was being played with 10 to a team (which was increased to 11).",sports
" When winter weather got too icy to play soccer, teams were taken indoors, and it was convenient to have them split in half and play basketball with five on each side.",sports
"Basketball's early adherents were dispatched to YMCAs throughout the United States, and it quickly spread through the United States and Canada.",sports
" By 1895, it was well established at several women's high schools.",sports
" While YMCA was responsible for initially developing and spreading the game, within a decade it discouraged the new sport, as rough play and rowdy crowds began to detract from YMCA's primary mission.",sports
" However, other amateur sports clubs, colleges, and professional clubs quickly filled the void.",sports
" In the years before World War I, the Amateur Athletic Union and the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (forerunner of the NCAA) vied for control over the rules for the game.",sports

Measurements and time limits discussed in this section often vary among tournaments and organizations; international and NBA rules are used in this section.,sports
The object of the game is to outscore one's opponents by throwing the ball through the opponents' basket from above while preventing the opponents from doing so on their own.,sports
" A successful shot is worth two points, or three points if it is taken from beyond the three-point arc 6.",sports
75 metres (22 ft 2 in) from the basket in international games and 23 feet 9 inches (7.,sports
 A one-point shot can be earned when shooting from the foul line after a foul is made.,sports
" After a team has scored from a field goal or free throw, play is resumed with a throw-in awarded to the non-scoring team taken from a point beyond the endline of the court where the points(s) were scored.",sports
Games are played in four quarters of 10 (FIBA) or 12 minutes (NBA).,sports
" College men's games use two 20-minute halves, college women's games use 10-minute quarters, and most United States high school varsity games use 8-minute quarters; however, this varies from state to state.",sports
" 15 minutes are allowed for a half-time break under FIBA, NBA, and NCAA rules and 10 minutes in United States high schools.",sports
" Overtime periods are five minutes in length except for high school, which is four minutes in length.",sports
 The time allowed is actual playing time; the clock is stopped while the play is not active.,sports
" Therefore, games generally take much longer to complete than the allotted game time, typically about two hours.",sports
Five players from each team may be on the court at one time.,sports
 Substitutions are unlimited but can only be done when play is stopped.,sports
" Teams also have a coach, who oversees the development and strategies of the team, and other team personnel such as assistant coaches, managers, statisticians, doctors and trainers.",sports
"For both men's and women's teams, a standard uniform consists of a pair of shorts and a jersey with a clearly visible number, unique within the team, printed on both the front and back.",sports
 Players wear high-top sneakers that provide extra ankle support.,sports
" Typically, team names, players' names and, outside of North America, sponsors are printed on the uniforms.",sports
"A limited number of time-outs, clock stoppages requested by a coach (or sometimes mandated in the NBA) for a short meeting with the players, are allowed.",sports
" They generally last no longer than one minute (100 seconds in the NBA) unless, for televised games, a commercial break is needed.",sports
"The game is controlled by the officials consisting of the referee (referred to as crew chief in the NBA), one or two umpires (referred to as referees in the NBA) and the table officials.",sports
" For college, the NBA, and many high schools, there are a total of three referees on the court.",sports
" The table officials are responsible for keeping track of each team's scoring, timekeeping, individual and team fouls, player substitutions, team possession arrow, and the shot clock.",sports
"The only essential equipment in a basketball game is the ball and the court: a flat, rectangular surface with baskets at opposite ends.",sports
" Competitive levels require the use of more equipment such as clocks, score sheets, scoreboard(s), alternating possession arrows, and whistle-operated stop-clock systems.",sports
A regulation basketball court in international games is 28 meters (92 feet) long and 15 meters (49 feet) wide.,sports
 In the NBA and NCAA the court is 94 by 50 feet (29 by 15 meters).,sports
" Most courts have wood flooring, usually constructed from maple planks running in the same direction as the longer court dimension.",sports
 The name and logo of the home team is usually painted on or around the center circle.,sports
The basket is a steel rim 18 inches (46 cm) diameter with an attached net affixed to a backboard that measures 6 by 3.,sports
 The white outlined box on the backboard is 18 inches (46 cm) high and 2 feet (61 cm) wide.,sports
" At almost all levels of competition, the top of the rim is exactly 10 feet (3.",sports
" While variation is possible in the dimensions of the court and backboard, it is considered important for the basket to be of the correct height – a rim that is off by just a few inches can have an adverse effect on shooting.",sports
"  The net must ""check the ball momentarily as it passes through the basket"" to aid the visual confirmation that the ball went through.",sports
  The act of checking the ball has the further advantage of slowing down the ball so the rebound doesn't go as far.,sports
"5 inches (75 cm) in circumference (size 7, or a ""295 ball"") and weighs 22 oz (623.",sports
"5 inches (72 cm) in circumference (size 6, or a ""285 ball"") with a weight of 20 oz (567 grams).",sports
" In 3x3, a formalized version of the halfcourt 3-on-3 game, a dedicated ball with the circumference of a size 6 ball but the weight of a size 7 ball is used in all competitions (men's, women's, and mixed teams).",sports
"The ball may be advanced toward the basket by being shot, passed between players, thrown, tapped, rolled or dribbled (bouncing the ball while running).",sports
The ball must stay within the court; the last team to touch the ball before it travels out of bounds forfeits possession.,sports
" The ball is out of bounds if it touches a boundary line, or touches any player or object that is out of bounds.",sports
"There are limits placed on the steps a player may take without dribbling, which commonly results in an infraction known as traveling.",sports
 Nor may a player stop his dribble and then resume dribbling.,sports
" A dribble that touches both hands is considered stopping the dribble, giving this infraction the name double dribble.",sports
" Within a dribble, the player cannot carry the ball by placing his hand on the bottom of the ball; doing so is known as carrying the ball.",sports
" A team, once having established ball control in the front half of their court, may not return the ball to the backcourt and be the first to touch it.",sports
" For the offense, a violation of these rules results in loss of possession; for the defense, most leagues reset the shot clock and the offensive team is given possession of the ball out of bounds.",sports
"There are limits imposed on the time taken before progressing the ball past halfway (8 seconds in FIBA and the NBA; 10 seconds in NCAA and high school for both sexes), before attempting a shot (24 seconds in FIBA, the NBA, and U Sports (Canadian universities) play for both sexes, and 30 seconds in NCAA play for both sexes), holding the ball while closely guarded (5 seconds), and remaining in the restricted area known as the free-throw lane, (or the ""key"") (3 seconds).",sports
There are also limits on how players may block an opponent's field goal attempt or help a teammate's field goal attempt.,sports
" Goaltending is a defender's touching of a ball that is on a downward flight toward the basket, while the related violation of basket interference is the touching of a ball that is on the rim or above the basket, or by a player reaching through the basket from below.",sports
" Goaltending and basket interference committed by a defender result in awarding the basket to the offense, while basket interference committed by an offensive player results in cancelling the basket if one is scored.",sports
 The defense gains possession in all cases of goaltending or basket interference.,sports
An attempt to unfairly disadvantage an opponent through certain types of physical contact is illegal and is called a personal foul.,sports
" These are most commonly committed by defensive players; however, they can be committed by offensive players as well.",sports
" Players who are fouled either receive the ball to pass inbounds again, or receive one or more free throws if they are fouled in the act of shooting, depending on whether the shot was successful.",sports
" One point is awarded for making a free throw, which is attempted from a line 15 feet (4.",sports
"The referee is responsible for judging whether contact is illegal, sometimes resulting in controversy.",sports
" The calling of fouls can vary between games, leagues and referees.",sports
"There is a second category of fouls called technical fouls, which may be charged for various rules violations including failure to properly record a player in the scorebook, or for unsportsmanlike conduct.",sports
" These infractions result in one or two free throws, which may be taken by any of the five players on the court at the time.",sports
 A blatant foul involving physical contact that is either excessive or unnecessary is called an intentional foul (flagrant foul in the NBA).,sports
" In FIBA and NCAA women's basketball, a foul resulting in ejection is called a disqualifying foul, while in leagues other than the NBA, such a foul is referred to as flagrant.",sports
"If a team exceeds a certain limit of team fouls in a given period (quarter or half) – four for NBA, NCAA women's, and international games – the opposing team is awarded one or two free throws on all subsequent non-shooting fouls for that period, the number depending on the league.",sports
" In the US college men's game and high school games for both sexes, if a team reaches 7 fouls in a half, the opposing team is awarded one free throw, along with a second shot if the first is made.",sports
" If a team exceeds 10 fouls in the half, the opposing team is awarded two free throws on all subsequent fouls for the half.",sports
"When a team shoots foul shots, the opponents may not interfere with the shooter, nor may they try to regain possession until the last or potentially last free throw is in the air.",sports
"After a team has committed a specified number of fouls, the other team is said to be ""in the bonus"".",sports
" On scoreboards, this is usually signified with an indicator light reading ""Bonus"" or ""Penalty"" with an illuminated directional arrow or dot indicating that team is to receive free throws when fouled by the opposing team.",sports
 (Some scoreboards also indicate the number of fouls committed.,sports
"If a team misses the first shot of a two-shot situation, the opposing team must wait for the completion of the second shot before attempting to reclaim possession of the ball and continuing play.",sports
"If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is unsuccessful, the player is awarded a number of free throws equal to the value of the attempted shot.",sports
" A player fouled while attempting a regular two-point shot thus receives two shots, and a player fouled while attempting a three-point shot receives three shots.",sports
"If a player is fouled while attempting a shot and the shot is successful, typically the player will be awarded one additional free throw for one point.",sports
" In combination with a regular shot, this is called a ""three-point play"" or ""four-point play"" (or more colloquially, an ""and one"") because of the basket made at the time of the foul (2 or 3 points) and the additional free throw (1 point).",sports
"Although the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball.",sports
" During the early years of basketball's evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used.",sports
" In more recent times specific positions evolved, but the current trend, advocated by many top coaches including Mike Krzyzewski, is towards positionless basketball, where big players are free to shoot from outside and dribble if their skill allows it.",sports
"Point guard (often called the ""1"") : usually the fastest player on the team, organizes the team's offense by controlling the ball and making sure that it gets to the right player at the right time.",sports
"Shooting guard (the ""2"") : creates a high volume of shots on offense, mainly long-ranged; and guards the opponent's best perimeter player on defense.",sports
"Small forward (the ""3"") : often primarily responsible for scoring points via cuts to the basket and dribble penetration; on defense seeks rebounds and steals, but sometimes plays more actively.",sports
"Power forward (the ""4""): plays offensively often with their back to the basket; on defense, plays under the basket (in a zone defense) or against the opposing power forward (in man-to-man defense).",sports
"Center (the ""5""): uses height and size to score (on offense), to protect the basket closely (on defense), or to rebound.",sports
" For most teams today, the shooting guard and small forward have very similar responsibilities and are often called the wings, as do the power forward and center, who are often called post players.",sports
" While most teams describe two players as guards, two as forwards, and one as a center, on some occasions teams choose to call them by different designations.",sports
There are two main defensive strategies: zone defense and man-to-man defense.,sports
" In a zone defense, each player is assigned to guard a specific area of the court.",sports
" Zone defenses often allow the defense to double team the ball, a manoeuver known as a trap.",sports
" In a man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards a specific opponent.",sports
"Offensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball.",sports
 A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is known as a cut.,sports
" A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent from guarding a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a screen or pick.",sports
" The two plays are combined in the pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then ""rolls"" away from the pick towards the basket.",sports
" Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork, which can lead to a successful basket.",sports
 Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable.,sports
" On court, the point guard is usually responsible for indicating which play will occur.",sports
"Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket, methods varying with players and situations.",sports
"Typically, a player faces the basket with both feet facing the basket.",sports
" A player will rest the ball on the fingertips of the dominant hand (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand supporting the side of the ball.",sports
 The ball is usually shot by jumping (though not always) and extending the shooting arm.,sports
" The shooting arm, fully extended with the wrist fully bent, is held stationary for a moment following the release of the ball, known as a follow-through.",sports
 Players often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to absorb its impact with the rim.,sports
" The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat controversial, but generally a proper arc is recommended.",sports
 Players may shoot directly into the basket or may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.,sports
The two most common shots that use the above described setup are the set shot and the jump shot.,sports
 Both are preceded by a crouching action which preloads the muscles and increases the power of the shot.,sports
" In a set shot, the shooter straightens up and throws from a standing position with neither foot leaving the floor; this is typically used for free throws.",sports
" For a jump shot, the throw is taken in mid-air with the ball being released near the top of the jump.",sports
" This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender.",sports
 Failure to release the ball before the feet return to the floor is considered a traveling violation.,sports
" This shot requires the player to be in motion toward the basket, and to ""lay"" the ball ""up"" and into the basket, typically off the backboard (the backboard-free, underhand version is called a finger roll).",sports
" The most crowd-pleasing and typically highest-percentage accuracy shot is the slam dunk, in which the player jumps very high and throws the ball downward, through the basket while touching it.",sports
"Another shot that is less common than the layup, is the ""circus shot"".",sports
" The circus shot is a low-percentage shot that is flipped, heaved, scooped, or flung toward the hoop while the shooter is off-balance, airborne, falling down, and/or facing away from the basket.",sports
" A back-shot is a shot taken when the player is facing away from the basket, and may be shot with the dominant hand, or both; but there is a very low chance that the shot will be successful.",sports
A shot that misses both the rim and the backboard completely is referred to as an air ball.,sports
" A particularly bad shot, or one that only hits the backboard, is jocularly called a brick.",sports
" The hang time is the length of time a player stays in the air after jumping, either to make a slam dunk, layup or jump shot.",sports
"The objective of rebounding is to successfully gain possession of the basketball after a missed field goal or free throw, as it rebounds from the hoop or backboard.",sports
" This plays a major role in the game, as most possessions end when a team misses a shot.",sports
" There are two categories of rebounds: offensive rebounds, in which the ball is recovered by the offensive side and does not change possession, and defensive rebounds, in which the defending team gains possession of the loose ball.",sports
" The majority of rebounds are defensive, as the team on defense tends to be in better position to recover missed shots.",sports
 Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.,sports
 The ball is passed directly from the passer's chest to the receiver's chest.,sports
 A proper chest pass involves an outward snap of the thumbs to add velocity and leaves the defence little time to react.,sports
" Here, the passer bounces the ball crisply about two-thirds of the way from his own chest to the receiver.",sports
 The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver.,sports
" The bounce pass takes longer to complete than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation).",sports
" Thus, players often use the bounce pass in crowded moments, or to pass around a defender.",sports
The outlet pass occurs after a team gets a defensive rebound.,sports
The crucial aspect of any good pass is it being difficult to intercept.,sports
 Good passers can pass the ball with great accuracy and they know exactly where each of their other teammates prefers to receive the ball.,sports
 A special way of doing this is passing the ball without looking at the receiving teammate.,sports
"Another advanced style of passing is the behind-the-back pass, which, as the description implies, involves throwing the ball behind the passer's back to a teammate.",sports

" This is called a crossover, which is the most effective way to move past defenders while dribbling.",sports
"A skilled player can dribble without watching the ball, using the dribbling motion or peripheral vision to keep track of the ball's location.",sports

" India has been first credited with having helped to popularise kabaddi as a competitive sport, with the first organized competitions occurring in the 1920s, their introduction to the programme of the Indian Olympic Games in 1938, the establishment of the All-India Kabaddi Federation in 1950, and it being played as a demonstration sport at the inaugural 1951 Asian Games in New Delhi.",sports
" These developments helped to formalize the sport, which had traditionally been played in villages, for legitimate international competition.",sports
"After being demonstrated again at the 1982 Asian Games in Delhi, Kabaddi was added to the Asian Games' programme beginning in 1990.",sports
"In the international team version of kabaddi, two teams of seven members each occupy opposite halves of a court of 10 by 13 metres (33 ft × 43 ft) in case of men and 8 by 12 metres (26 ft × 39 ft) in case of women.",sports
 Each has five supplementary players held in reserve for substitution.,sports
 The game is played with 20-minute halves with a 5-minute half break in which the teams exchange sides.,sports
" During each play, known as a ""raid"", a player from the attacking side, known as the ""raider"", runs into the opposing team's side of the court and attempts to tag as many of the seven defending players as possible.",sports
" The raider must cross the baulk line into the defending team's territory, and then return to their half of the field without being tackled.",sports
" (If an attacker touches a defender and hasn't yet reached the baulk line, they don't need to reach the baulk line to score points and may return to their half of the court.",sports
") While raiding, the raider must loudly chant kabaddi, confirming to referees that their raid is done on a single breath without inhaling.",sports
" If the raider steps beyond the bonus line marked in the defending team's territory, they earn an additional point known as a bonus point.",sports
" If the raider is successfully stopped (tackled), the opposite team earns a point instead.",sports
" All players tagged are taken out of the game, but one is ""revived"" for each point a team scores from a subsequent tag or tackle.",sports
" A raid where no points are scored by the raider is referred to as an ""empty raid"".",sports
" By contrast, a play where the raider scores three or more points is referred to as a ""super raid"".",sports
" If a team gets all seven players on the opposing team out at once (""All Out""), they earn two additional points and the players are placed back in the game.",sports

 The team that is successful in outing all the players of the opponent's side secures a point.,sports
 The game continues until five or seven such points are secured and has no fixed time duration.,sports
" Amar style resembles the Sanjeevani form in the time frame rule, but a player who is declared out stays inside the court while play continues.",sports

" Master Michel Angelo), whose chapter XI was titled ""New Improvements on the Game of Hockey"".",sports
" The belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by King Edward III of England is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in Latin and explicitly forbade the games ""Pilam Manualem, Pedivam, & Bacularem: & ad Canibucam & Gallorum Pugnam"".",sports
" The English historian and biographer John Strype did not use the word ""hockey"" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, instead translating ""Canibucam"" as ""Cambuck""; this may have referred to either an early form of hockey or a game more similar to golf or croquet.",sports
" One supposition is that it is a derivative of hoquet, a Middle French word for a shepherd's stave.",sports
" The curved, or ""hooked"" ends of the sticks used for hockey would indeed have resembled these staves.",sports
" Another supposition derives from the known use of cork bungs (stoppers), in place of wooden balls to play the game.",sports
" The stoppers came from barrels containing ""hock"" ale, also called ""hocky"".",sports
Games played with curved sticks and a ball can be found in the histories of many cultures.,sports
" In Egypt, 4000-year-old carvings feature teams with sticks and a projectile, hurling dates to before 1272 BC in Ireland, and there is a depiction from approximately 600 BC in Ancient Greece, where the game may have been called kerētízein or (κερητίζειν) because it was played with a horn or horn-like stick (kéras, κέρας).",sports

"A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.",sports
" Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements.",sports
" However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).",sports
"Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well.",sports
" They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals.",sports
" The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship.",sports
" On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play.",sports
" Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.",sports
"Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction.",sports
" Games generally involve mental or physical stimulation, and often both.",sports
" Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role.",sports
"Attested as early as 2600 BC, games are a universal part of human experience and present in all cultures.",sports
" The Royal Game of Ur, Senet, and Mancala are some of the oldest known games.",sports
Ludwig Wittgenstein was probably the first academic philosopher to address the definition of the word game.,sports
" In his Philosophical Investigations, Wittgenstein argued that the elements of games, such as play, rules, and competition, all fail to adequately define what games are.",sports
" From this, Wittgenstein concluded that people apply the term game to a range of disparate human activities that bear to one another only what one might call family resemblances.",sports
" As the following game definitions show, this conclusion was not a final one and today many philosophers, like Thomas Hurka, think that Wittgenstein was wrong and that Bernard Suits' definition is a good answer to the problem.",sports
"French sociologist Roger Caillois, in his book Les jeux et les hommes (Games and Men), defined a game as an activity that must have the following characteristics:
",sports
"fun: the activity is chosen for its light-hearted character
",sports
"non-productive: participation does not accomplish anything useful
",sports
"governed by rules: the activity has rules that are different from everyday life
",sports
"fictitious: it is accompanied by the awareness of a different reality
",sports
Game designer Chris Crawford defined the term in the context of computers.,sports
"Creative expression is art if made for its own beauty, and entertainment if made for money.",sports
A piece of entertainment is a plaything if it is interactive.,sports
 Movies and books are cited as examples of non-interactive entertainment.,sports
" (Crawford notes that by his definition, (a) a toy can become a game element if the player makes up rules, and (b) The Sims and SimCity are toys, not games.",sports
"If a challenge has no ""active agent against whom you compete"", it is a puzzle; if there is one, it is a conflict.",sports
 Video games with noticeably algorithmic artificial intelligence can be played as puzzles; these include the patterns used to evade ghosts in Pac-Man.,sports
"Finally, if the player can only outperform the opponent, but not attack them to interfere with their performance, the conflict is a competition.",sports
") However, if attacks are allowed, then the conflict qualifies as a game.",sports
"Crawford's definition may thus be rendered as: an interactive, goal-oriented activity made for money, with active agents to play against, in which players (including active agents) can interfere with each other.",sports
"Other definitions, however, as well as history, show that entertainment and games are not necessarily undertaken for monetary gain.",sports
"""A game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome.",sports
"""A game is a form of art in which participants, termed players, make decisions in order to manage resources through game tokens in the pursuit of a goal.",sports
""" (Greg Costikyan) According to this definition, some ""games"" that do not involve choices, such as Chutes and Ladders, Candy Land, and War are not technically games any more than a slot machine is.",sports
"""A game is an activity among two or more independent decision-makers seeking to achieve their objectives in some limiting context.",sports
"""At its most elementary level then we can define game as an exercise of voluntary control systems in which there is an opposition between forces, confined by a procedure and rules in order to produce a disequilibrial outcome.",sports
"""to play a game is to engage in activity directed toward bringing about a specific state of affairs, using only means permitted by specific rules, where the means permitted by the rules are more limited in scope than they would be in the absence of the rules, and where the sole reason for accepting such limitation is to make possible such activity.",sports
"""When you strip away the genre differences and the technological complexities, all games share four defining traits: a goal, rules, a feedback system, and voluntary participation.",sports
 Major key elements identified in this context are tools and rules that define the overall context of game.,sports
Games are often classified by the components required to play them (e.,sports
" miniatures, a ball, cards, a board and pieces, or a computer).",sports
" In places where the use of leather is well-established, the ball has been a popular game piece throughout recorded history, resulting in a worldwide popularity of ball games such as rugby, basketball, soccer (football), cricket, tennis, and volleyball.",sports
" Many countries in Europe, for instance, have unique standard decks of playing cards.",sports
 Other games such as chess may be traced primarily through the development and evolution of its game pieces.,sports
"Many game tools are tokens, meant to represent other things.",sports
" A token may be a pawn on a board, play money, or an intangible item such as a point scored.",sports
"Games such as hide-and-seek or tag do not use any obvious tool; rather, their interactivity is defined by the environment.",sports
 Games with the same or similar rules may have different gameplay if the environment is altered.,sports
" For example, hide-and-seek in a school building differs from the same game in a park; an auto race can be radically different depending on the track or street course, even with the same cars.",sports
"Whereas games are often characterized by their tools, they are often defined by their rules.",sports
" While rules are subject to variations and changes, enough change in the rules usually results in a ""new"" game.",sports
" For instance, baseball can be played with ""real"" baseballs or with wiffleballs.",sports
" However, if the players decide to play with only three bases, they are arguably playing a different game.",sports
" There are exceptions to this in that some games deliberately involve the changing of their own rules, but even then there are often immutable meta-rules.",sports
"Rules generally determine the time-keeping system, the rights and responsibilities of the players, and each player's goals.",sports
 Player rights may include when they may spend resources or move tokens.,sports
" For most competitive games, the ultimate aim is winning: in this sense, checkmate is the aim of chess.",sports
" Common win conditions are being first to amass a certain quota of points or tokens (as in Settlers of Catan), having the greatest number of tokens at the end of the game (as in Monopoly), or some relationship of one's game tokens to those of one's opponent (as in chess's checkmate).",sports
" There may also be intermediate aims, which are tasks that move a player toward winning.",sports
" For instance, an intermediate aim in football is to score goals, because scoring goals will increase one's likelihood of winning the game, but isn't alone sufficient to win the game.",sports
"An aim identifies a sufficient condition for successful action, whereas the rule identifies a necessary condition for permissible action.",sports
" For example, the aim of chess is to checkmate, but although it is expected that players will try to checkmate each other, it is not a rule of chess that a player must checkmate the other player whenever possible.",sports
" Similarly, it is not a rule of football that a player must score a goal on a penalty; while it is expected the player will try, it is not required.",sports
" While meeting the aims often requires a certain degree of skill and (in some cases) luck, following the rules of a game merely requires knowledge of the rules and some careful attempt to follow them; it rarely (if ever) requires luck or demanding skills.",sports
"A game's tools and rules will result in its requiring skill, strategy, luck, or a combination thereof, and are classified accordingly.",sports
"Games of skill include games of physical skill, such as wrestling, tug of war, hopscotch, target shooting, and stake, and games of mental skill such as checkers and chess.",sports
" Games of strategy include checkers, chess, Go, arimaa, and tic-tac-toe, and often require special equipment to play them.",sports
" Games of chance include gambling games (blackjack, Mahjong, roulette, etc.",sports
"), as well as snakes and ladders and rock, paper, scissors; most require equipment such as cards or dice.",sports
" However, most games contain two or all three of these elements.",sports
" For example, American football and baseball involve both physical skill and strategy while tiddlywinks, poker, and Monopoly combine strategy and chance.",sports
" Many card and board games combine all three; most trick-taking games involve mental skill, strategy, and an element of chance, as do many strategic board games such as Risk, Settlers of Catan, and Carcassonne.",sports
" However, single-player games are unique in respect to the type of challenges a player faces.",sports
" Unlike a game with multiple players competing with or against each other to reach the game's goal, a one-player game is a battle solely against an element of the environment (an artificial opponent), against one's own skills, against time, or against chance.",sports
 Playing with a yo-yo or playing tennis against a wall is not generally recognized as playing a game due to the lack of any formidable opposition.,sports
" Many games described as ""single-player"" may be termed actually puzzles or recreations.",sports
A multiplayer game is a game of several players who may be independent opponents or teams.,sports
 Games with many independent players are difficult to analyze formally using game theory as the players may form and switch coalitions.,sports
" The term ""game"" in this context may mean either a true game played for entertainment or a competitive activity describable in principle by mathematical game theory.",sports
John Nash proved that games with several players have a stable solution provided that coalitions between players are disallowed.,sports
 Nash won the Nobel prize for economics for this important result which extended von Neumann's theory of zero-sum games.,sports
"If cooperation between players is allowed, then the game becomes more complex; many concepts have been developed to analyze such games.",sports
" While these have had some partial success in the fields of economics, politics and conflict, no good general theory has yet been developed.",sports
"In quantum game theory, it has been found that the introduction of quantum information into multiplayer games allows a new type of equilibrium strategy not found in traditional games.",sports
 The entanglement of players's choices can have the effect of a contract by preventing players from profiting from what is known as betrayal.,sports
"Games can take a variety of forms, from competitive sports to board games and video games.",sports
"Many sports require special equipment and dedicated playing fields, leading to the involvement of a community much larger than the group of players.",sports
 A city or town may set aside such resources for the organization of sports leagues.,sports
Popular sports may have spectators who are entertained just by watching games.,sports
 A community will often align itself with a local sports team that supposedly represents it (even if the team or most of its players only recently moved in); they often align themselves against their opponents or have traditional rivalries.,sports
"Certain competitive sports, such as racing and gymnastics, are not games by definitions such as Crawford's (see above) – despite the inclusion of many in the Olympic Games – because competitors do not interact with their opponents; they simply challenge each other in indirect ways.",sports
"Lawn games are outdoor games that can be played on a lawn; an area of mowed grass (or alternately, on graded soil) generally smaller than a sports field (pitch).",sports
" Variations of many games that are traditionally played on a sports field are marketed as ""lawn games"" for home use in a front or back yard.",sports
" Common lawn games include horseshoes, sholf, croquet, bocce, and lawn bowls.",sports
"A tabletop game is a game where the elements of play are confined to a small area and require little physical exertion, usually simply placing, picking up and moving game pieces.",sports
 Most of these games are played at a table around which the players are seated and on which the game's elements are located.,sports
" However, many games falling into this category, particularly party games, are more free-form in their play and can involve physical activity such as mime.",sports
" Still, these games do not require a large area in which to play them, large amounts of strength or stamina, or specialized equipment other than what comes in a box.",sports
"This class of games includes any game in which the skill element involved relates to manual dexterity or hand-eye coordination, but excludes the class of video games (see below).",sports
" Games such as jacks, paper football, and Jenga require only very portable or improvised equipment and can be played on any flat level surface, while other examples, such as pinball, billiards, air hockey, foosball, and table hockey require specialized tables or other self-contained modules on which the game is played.",sports
" The advent of home video game systems largely replaced some of these, such as table hockey, however air hockey, billiards, pinball and foosball remain popular fixtures in private and public game rooms.",sports
" These games and others, as they require reflexes and coordination, are generally performed more poorly by intoxicated persons but are unlikely to result in injury because of this; as such the games are popular as drinking games.",sports
" In addition, dedicated drinking games such as quarters and beer pong also involve physical coordination and are popular for similar reasons.",sports
"Board games use as a central tool a board on which the players' status, resources, and progress are tracked using physical tokens.",sports
" Most games that simulate war are board games (though a large number of video games have been created to simulate strategic combat), and the board may be a map on which the players' tokens move.",sports
" Virtually all board games involve ""turn-based"" play; one player contemplates and then makes a move, then the next player does the same, and a player can only act on their turn.",sports
" This is opposed to ""real-time"" play as is found in some card games, most sports and most video games.",sports
"Some games, such as chess and Go, are entirely deterministic, relying only on the strategy element for their interest.",sports
" Such games are usually described as having ""perfect information""; the only unknown is the exact thought processes of one's opponent, not the outcome of any unknown event inherent in the game (such as a card draw or die roll).",sports
" Children's games, on the other hand, tend to be very luck-based, with games such as Candy Land and Chutes and Ladders having virtually no decisions to be made.",sports
" By some definitions, such as that by Greg Costikyan, they are not games since there are no decisions to make which affect the outcome.",sports
" Many other games involving a high degree of luck do not allow direct attacks between opponents; the random event simply determines a gain or loss in the standing of the current player within the game, which is independent of any other player; the ""game"" then is actually a ""race"" by definitions such as Crawford's.",sports
Most other board games combine strategy and luck factors; the game of backgammon requires players to decide the best strategic move based on the roll of two dice.,sports
 Trivia games have a great deal of randomness based on the questions a person gets.,sports
 German-style board games are notable for often having rather less of a luck factor than many board games.,sports
"Board game groups include race games, roll-and-move games, abstract strategy games, word games, and wargames, as well as trivia and other elements.",sports
" Some board games fall into multiple groups or incorporate elements of other genres: Cranium is one popular example, where players must succeed in each of four skills: artistry, live performance, trivia, and language.",sports
" These cards may be a standard Anglo-American (52-card) deck of playing cards (such as for bridge, poker, Rummy, etc.",sports
"), a regional deck using 32, 36 or 40 cards and different suit signs (such as for the popular German game skat), a tarot deck of 78 cards (used in Europe to play a variety of trick-taking games collectively known as Tarot, Tarock or Tarocchi games), or a deck specific to the individual game (such as Set or 1000 Blank White Cards).",sports
 Uno and Rook are examples of games that were originally played with a standard deck and have since been commercialized with customized decks.,sports
 Some collectible card games such as Magic: The Gathering are played with a small selection of cards that have been collected or purchased individually from large available sets.,sports
"Some board games include a deck of cards as a gameplay element, normally for randomization or to keep track of game progress.",sports
" Conversely, some card games such as Cribbage use a board with movers, normally to keep score.",sports
" The differentiation between the two genres in such cases depends on which element of the game is foremost in its play; a board game using cards for random actions can usually use some other method of randomization, while Cribbage can just as easily be scored on paper.",sports
 These elements as used are simply the traditional and easiest methods to achieve their purpose.,sports
" Board games often use dice for a randomization element, and thus each roll of the dice has a profound impact on the outcome of the game, however dice games are differentiated in that the dice do not determine the success or failure of some other element of the game; they instead are the central indicator of the person's standing in the game.",sports
" Popular dice games include Yahtzee, Farkle, Bunco, Liar's dice/Perudo, and Poker dice.",sports
" As dice are, by their very nature, designed to produce apparently random numbers, these games usually involve a high degree of luck, which can be directed to some extent by the player through more strategic elements of play and through tenets of probability theory.",sports
" Such games are thus popular as gambling games; the game of Craps is perhaps the most famous example, though Liar's dice and Poker dice were originally conceived of as gambling games.",sports
"Domino games are similar in many respects to card games, but the generic device is instead a set of tiles called dominoes, which traditionally each have two ends, each with a given number of dots, or ""pips"", and each combination of two possible end values as it appears on a tile is unique in the set.",sports
" The games played with dominoes largely center around playing a domino from the player's ""hand"" onto the matching end of another domino, and the overall object could be to always be able to make a play, to make all open endpoints sum to a given number or multiple, or simply to play all dominoes from one's hand onto the board.",sports
" Sets vary in the number of possible dots on one end, and thus of the number of combinations and pieces; the most common set historically is double-six, though in more recent times ""extended"" sets such as double-nine have been introduced to increase the number of dominoes available, which allows larger hands and more players in a game.",sports
" Muggins, Mexican Train, and Chicken Foot are very popular domino games.",sports
" Texas 42 is a domino game more similar in its play to a ""trick-taking"" card game.",sports
Variations of traditional dominoes abound: Triominoes are similar in theory but are triangular and thus have three values per tile.,sports
" Similarly, a game known as Quad-Ominos uses four-sided tiles.",sports
"Some other games use tiles in place of cards; Rummikub is a variant of the Rummy card game family that uses tiles numbered in ascending rank among four colors, very similar in makeup to a 2-deck ""pack"" of Anglo-American playing cards.",sports
 Mahjong is another game very similar to Rummy that uses a set of tiles with card-like values and art.,sports
"Lastly, some games use graphical tiles to form a board layout, on which other elements of the game are played.",sports
" In each, the ""board"" is made up of a series of tiles; in Settlers of Catan the starting layout is random but static, while in Carcassonne the game is played by ""building"" the board tile-by-tile.",sports
" Hive, an abstract strategy game using tiles as moving pieces, has mechanical and strategic elements similar to chess, although it has no board; the pieces themselves both form the layout and can move within it.",sports
"Pencil and paper games require little or no specialized equipment other than writing materials, though some such games have been commercialized as board games (Scrabble, for instance, is based on the idea of a crossword puzzle, and tic-tac-toe sets with a boxed grid and pieces are available commercially).",sports
" These games vary widely, from games centering on a design being drawn such as Pictionary and ""connect-the-dots"" games like sprouts, to letter and word games such as Boggle and Scattergories, to solitaire and logic puzzle games such as Sudoku and crossword puzzles.",sports
"A guessing game has as its core a piece of information that one player knows, and the object is to coerce others into guessing that piece of information without actually divulging it in text or spoken word.",sports
" Charades is probably the most well-known game of this type, and has spawned numerous commercial variants that involve differing rules on the type of communication to be given, such as Catch Phrase, Taboo, Pictionary, and similar.",sports
" The genre also includes many game shows such as Win, Lose or Draw, Password and $25,000 Pyramid.",sports
Video games are computer- or microprocessor-controlled games.,sports
 Computers can create virtual spaces for a wide variety of game types.,sports
" Some video games simulate conventional game objects like cards or dice, while others can simulate environs either grounded in reality or fantastical in design, each with its own set of rules or goals.",sports
"A computer or video game uses one or more input devices, typically a button/joystick combination (on arcade games); a keyboard, mouse or trackball (computer games); or a controller or a motion sensitive tool (console games).",sports
 More esoteric devices such as paddle controllers have also been used for input.,sports
"There are many genres of video game; the first commercial video game, Pong, was a simple simulation of table tennis.",sports
" As processing power increased, new genres such as adventure and action games were developed that involved a player guiding a character from a third person perspective through a series of obstacles.",sports
" This ""real-time"" element cannot be easily reproduced by a board game, which is generally limited to ""turn-based"" strategy; this advantage allows video games to simulate situations such as combat more realistically.",sports
" Additionally, the playing of a video game does not require the same physical skill, strength or danger as a real-world representation of the game, and can provide either very realistic, exaggerated or impossible physics, allowing for elements of a fantastical nature, games involving physical violence, or simulations of sports.",sports
" Lastly, a computer can, with varying degrees of success, simulate one or more human opponents in traditional table games such as chess, leading to simulations of such games that can be played by a single player.",sports
"In more open-ended computer simulations, also known as sandbox-style games, the game provides a virtual environment in which the player may be free to do whatever they like within the confines of this universe.",sports
" Sometimes, there is a lack of goals or opposition, which has stirred some debate on whether these should be considered ""games"" or ""toys"".",sports
 (Crawford specifically mentions Will Wright's SimCity as an example of a toy.,sports
Online games have been part of culture from the very earliest days of networked and time-shared computers.,sports
 Early commercial systems such as Plato were at least as widely famous for their games as for their strictly educational value.,sports
" In 1958, Tennis for Two dominated Visitor's Day and drew attention to the oscilloscope at the Brookhaven National Laboratory; during the 1980s, Xerox PARC was known mainly for Maze War, which was offered as a hands-on demo to visitors.",sports
"Modern online games are played using an Internet connection; some have dedicated client programs, while others require only a web browser.",sports
 Some simpler browser games appeal to more casual gaming demographic groups (notably older audiences) that otherwise play very few video games.,sports
"Role-playing games, often abbreviated as RPGs, are a type of game in which the participants (usually) assume the roles of characters acting in a fictional setting.",sports
" The original role playing games – or at least those explicitly marketed as such – are played with a handful of participants, usually face-to-face, and keep track of the developing fiction with pen and paper.",sports
" Together, the players may collaborate on a story involving those characters; create, develop, and ""explore"" the setting; or vicariously experience an adventure outside the bounds of everyday life.",sports
" Pen-and-paper role-playing games include, for example, Dungeons & Dragons and GURPS.",sports
The term role-playing game has also been appropriated by the video game industry to describe a genre of video games.,sports
" These may be single-player games where one player experiences a programmed environment and story, or they may allow players to interact through the internet.",sports
 The experience is usually quite different from traditional role-playing games.,sports
" Single-player games include Final Fantasy, Fable, The Elder Scrolls, and Mass Effect.",sports
" Online multi-player games, often referred to as Massively Multiplayer Online role playing games, or MMORPGs, include RuneScape, EverQuest 2, Guild Wars, MapleStory, Anarchy Online, and Dofus.",sports
" As of 2009, the most successful MMORPG has been World of Warcraft, which controls the vast majority of the market.",sports
"Business games can take a variety of forms, from interactive board games to interactive games involving different props (balls, ropes, hoops, etc.",sports
 The purpose of these games is to link to some aspect of organizational performance and to generate discussions about business improvement.,sports
 Some of these are computer simulations while others are simple designs for play and debriefing.,sports
"The term ""game"" can include simulation or re-enactment of various activities or use in ""real life"" for various purposes: e.",sports
" The root of this meaning may originate in the human prehistory of games deduced by anthropology from observing primitive cultures, in which children's games mimic the activities of adults to a significant degree: hunting, warring, nursing, etc.",sports
"Politics (from Greek: Πολιτικά, politiká, 'affairs of the cities') is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status.",politics
 The branch of social science that studies politics is referred to as political science.,politics
"It may be used positively in the context of a ""political solution"" which is compromising and non-violent, or descriptively as ""the art or science of government"", but also often carries a negative connotation.",politics
" For example, abolitionist Wendell Phillips declared that ""we do not play politics; anti-slavery is no half-jest with us.",politics
""" The concept has been defined in various ways, and different approaches have fundamentally differing views on whether it should be used extensively or limitedly, empirically or normatively, and on whether conflict or co-operation is more essential to it.",politics
"A variety of methods are deployed in politics, which include promoting one's own political views among people, negotiation with other political subjects, making laws, and exercising force, including warfare against adversaries.",politics
" Politics is exercised on a wide range of social levels, from clans and tribes of traditional societies, through modern local governments, companies and institutions up to sovereign states, to the international level.",politics
" In modern nation states, people often form political parties to represent their ideas.",politics
 Members of a party often agree to take the same position on many issues and agree to support the same changes to law and the same leaders.,politics
 An election is usually a competition between different parties.,politics
A political system is a framework which defines acceptable political methods within a society.,politics
" The history of political thought can be traced back to early antiquity, with seminal works such as Plato's Republic, Aristotle's Politics, Chanakya's Arthashastra and Chanakya Niti (3rd century BCE), as well as the works of Confucius.",politics
"The English politics has its roots in the name of Aristotle's classic work, Politiká, which introduced the Greek term politiká (Πολιτικά, 'affairs of the cities').",politics
" In the mid-15th century, Aristotle's composition would be rendered in Early Modern English as Polettiques [sic], which would become Politics in Modern English.",politics
"The singular politic first attested in English in 1430, coming from Middle French politique—itself taking from politicus, a Latinization of the Greek πολιτικός (politikos) from πολίτης (polites, 'citizen') and πόλις (polis, 'city').",politics
"In the view of Harold Lasswell, politics is ""who gets what, when, how.",politics
"""For David Easton, it is about ""the authoritative allocation of values for a society.",politics
"""To Vladimir Lenin, ""politics is the most concentrated expression of economics.",politics
"""Bernard Crick argued that ""politics is a distinctive form of rule whereby people act together through institutionalized procedures to resolve differences, to conciliate diverse interests and values and to make public policies in the pursuit of common purposes.",politics
"""According to Adrian Leftwich:Politics comprises all the activities of co-operation, negotiation and conflict within and between societies, whereby people go about organizing the use, production or distribution of human, natural and other resources in the course of the production and reproduction of their biological and social life.",politics
There are several ways in which approaching politics has been conceptualized.,politics
Adrian Leftwich has differentiated views of politics based on how extensive or limited their perception of what accounts as 'political' is.,politics
" The extensive view sees politics as present across the sphere of human social relations, while the limited view restricts it to certain contexts.",politics
" For example, in a more restrictive way, politics may be viewed as primarily about governance, while a feminist perspective could argue that sites which have been viewed traditionally as non-political, should indeed be viewed as political as well.",politics
" This latter position is encapsulated in the slogan the personal is political, which disputes the distinction between private and public issues.",politics
" Instead, politics may be defined by the use of power, as has been argued by Robert A.",politics
"Some perspectives on politics view it empirically as an exercise of power, while others see it as a social function with a normative basis.",politics
 This distinction has been called the difference between political moralism and political realism.,politics
" For moralists, politics is closely linked to ethics, and is at its extreme in utopian thinking.",politics
" For example, according to Hannah Arendt, the view of Aristotle was that ""to be political…meant that everything was decided through words and persuasion and not through violence;"" while according to Bernard Crick ""[p]olitics is the way in which free societies are governed.",politics
 Politics is politics and other forms of rule are something else.,politics
""" In contrast, for realists, represented by those such as Niccolò Machiavelli, Thomas Hobbes, and Harold Lasswell, politics is based on the use of power, irrespective of the ends being pursued.",politics
Agonism argues that politics essentially comes down to conflict between conflicting interests.,politics
" Political scientist Elmer Schattschneider argued that ""at the root of all politics is the universal language of conflict,"" while for Carl Schmitt the essence of politics is the distinction of 'friend' from foe'.",politics
 This is in direct contrast to the more co-operative views of politics by Aristotle and Crick.,politics
" However, a more mixed view between these extremes is provided by Irish political scientist Michael Laver, who noted that:Politics is about the characteristic blend of conflict and co-operation that can be found so often in human interactions.",politics
The history of politics spans human history and is not limited to modern institutions of government.,politics
"Frans de Waal argued that already chimpanzees engage in politics through ""social manipulation to secure and maintain influential positions.",politics
""" Early human forms of social organization—bands and tribes—lacked centralized political structures.",politics
"In ancient history, civilizations did not have definite boundaries as states have today, and their borders could be more accurately described as frontiers.",politics
" Early dynastic Sumer, and early dynastic Egypt were the first civilizations to define their borders.",politics
" Moreover, up to the 12th century, many people lived in non-state societies.",politics
 These range from relatively egalitarian bands and tribes to complex and highly stratified chiefdoms.,politics
There are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not others.,politics
 Other scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.,politics
Voluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest.,politics
" The theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formation.",politics
" One of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the hydraulic hypothesis, which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects.",politics
Conflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states.,politics
" In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others.",politics
 Some theories in turn argue that warfare was critical for state formation.,politics
"The first states of sorts were those of early dynastic Sumer and early dynastic Egypt, which arose from the Uruk period and Predynastic Egypt respectively around approximately 3000 BCE.",politics
" Early dynastic Egypt was based around the Nile River in the north-east of Africa, the kingdom's boundaries being based around the Nile and stretching to areas where oases existed.",politics
 Early dynastic Sumer was located in southern Mesopotamia with its borders extending from the Persian Gulf to parts of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers.,politics
"Although state-forms existed before the rise of the Ancient Greek empire, the Greeks were the first people known to have explicitly formulated a political philosophy of the state, and to have rationally analyzed political institutions.",politics
" Prior to this, states were described and justified in terms of religious myths.",politics
Several important political innovations of classical antiquity came from the Greek city-states (polis) and the Roman Republic.,politics
 The Greek city-states before the 4th century granted citizenship rights to their free population; in Athens these rights were combined with a directly democratic form of government that was to have a long afterlife in political thought and history.,politics
"The Peace of Westphalia (1648) is considered by political scientists to be the beginning of the modern international system, in which external powers should avoid interfering in another country's domestic affairs.",politics
 The principle of non-interference in other countries' domestic affairs was laid out in the mid-18th century by Swiss jurist Emer de Vattel.,politics
 States became the primary institutional agents in an interstate system of relations.,politics
 The Peace of Westphalia is said to have ended attempts to impose supranational authority on European states.,politics
" The ""Westphalian"" doctrine of states as independent agents was bolstered by the rise in 19th century thought of nationalism, under which legitimate states were assumed to correspond to nations—groups of people united by language and culture.",politics
"In Europe, during the 18th century, the classic non-national states were the multinational empires: the Austrian Empire, Kingdom of France, Kingdom of Hungary, the Russian Empire, the Spanish Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the British Empire.",politics
" Such empires also existed in Asia, Africa, and the Americas; in the Muslim world, immediately after the death of Muhammad in 632, Caliphates were established, which developed into multi-ethnic trans-national empires.",politics
" The multinational empire was an absolute monarchy ruled by a king, emperor or sultan.",politics
" The population belonged to many ethnic groups, and they spoke many languages.",politics
" The empire was dominated by one ethnic group, and their language was usually the language of public administration.",politics
" The ruling dynasty was usually, but not always, from that group.",politics
" Some of the smaller European states were not so ethnically diverse, but were also dynastic states, ruled by a royal house.",politics
" A few of the smaller states survived, such as the independent principalities of Liechtenstein, Andorra, Monaco, and the republic of San Marino.",politics
"Most theories see the nation state as a 19th-century European phenomenon, facilitated by developments such as state-mandated education, mass literacy, and mass media.",politics
" However, historians also note the early emergence of a relatively unified state and identity in Portugal and the Dutch Republic.",politics
" Scholars such as Steven Weber, David Woodward, Michel Foucault, and Jeremy Black have advanced the hypothesis that the nation state did not arise out of political ingenuity or an unknown undetermined source, nor was it an accident of history or political invention.",politics
" Rather, the nation state is an inadvertent byproduct of 15th-century intellectual discoveries in political economy, capitalism, mercantilism, political geography, and geography combined together with cartography and advances in map-making technologies.",politics
"Some nation states, such as Germany and Italy, came into existence at least partly as a result of political campaigns by nationalists, during the 19th century.",politics
" In both cases, the territory was previously divided among other states, some of them very small.",politics
" Liberal ideas of free trade played a role in German unification, which was preceded by a customs union, the Zollverein.",politics
" National self-determination was a key aspect of United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points, leading to the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, while the Russian Empire became the Soviet Union after the Russian Civil War.",politics
 Decolonization lead to the creation of new nation states in place of multinational empires in the Third World.,politics
Political globalization began in the 20th century through intergovernmental organizations and supranational unions.,politics
" The League of Nations was founded after World War I, and after World War II it was replaced by the United Nations.",politics
 Various international treaties have been signed through it.,politics
" Regional integration has been pursued by the African Union, ASEAN, the European Union, and Mercosur.",politics
" International political institutions on the international level include the International Criminal Court, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Trade Organization.",politics
"The study of politics is called political science, or politology.",politics
" It comprises numerous subfields, including comparative politics, political economy, international relations, political philosophy, public administration, public policy, gender and politics, and political methodology.",politics
" Furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of economics, law, sociology, history, philosophy, geography, psychology/psychiatry, anthropology, and neurosciences.",politics
"Comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of constitutions, political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective.",politics
 International relations deals with the interaction between nation-states as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations.,politics
 Political philosophy is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.,politics
"Political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in psychology, social research, and cognitive neuroscience.",politics
" Approaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational choice theory, behavioralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism, institutionalism, and pluralism.",politics
" Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, survey research, statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research, and model building.",politics
The political system defines the process for making official government decisions.,politics
" It is usually compared to the legal system, economic system, cultural system, and other social systems.",politics
" According to David Easton, ""A political system can be designated as the interactions through which values are authoritatively allocated for a society.",politics
""" Each political system is embedded in a society with its own political culture, and they in turn shape their societies through public policy.",politics
 The interactions between different political systems are the basis for global politics.,politics
" In terms of the structure of power, there are monarchies (including constitutional monarchies) and republics (usually presidential, semi-presidential, or parliamentary).",politics
"The separation of powers describes the degree of horizontal integration between the legislature, the executive, the judiciary, and other independent institutions.",politics
"The source of power determines the difference between democracies, oligarchies, and autocracies.",politics
"In a democracy, political legitimacy is based on popular sovereignty.",politics
" Forms of democracy include representative democracy, direct democracy, and demarchy.",politics
" These are separated by the way decisions are made, whether by elected representatives, referendums, or by citizen juries.",politics
 Democracies can be either republics or constitutional monarchies.,politics
" These may be in the form of anocracy, aristocracy, ergatocracy, geniocracy, gerontocracy, kakistocracy, kleptocracy, meritocracy, noocracy, particracy, plutocracy, stratocracy, technocracy, theocracy, or timocracy.",politics
Autocracies are either dictatorships (including military dictatorships) or absolute monarchies.,politics
"In terms of level of vertical integration, political systems can be divided into (from least to most integrated) confederations, federations, and unitary states.",politics
"A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing provinces, states, or other regions under a central federal government (federalism).",politics
" In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body.",politics
" Federations were formed first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, Australia.",politics
" Compared to a federation, a confederation has less centralized power.",politics
"All the above forms of government are variations of the same basic polity, the sovereign state.",politics
" The state has been defined by Max Weber as a political entity that has monopoly on violence within its territory, while the Montevideo Convention holds that states need to have a defined territory; a permanent population; a government; and a capacity to enter into international relations.",politics
A stateless society is a society that is not governed by a state.,politics
" In stateless societies, there is little concentration of authority; most positions of authority that do exist are very limited in power and are generally not permanently held positions; and social bodies that resolve disputes through predefined rules tend to be small.",politics
 Stateless societies are highly variable in economic organization and cultural practices.,politics
"While stateless societies were the norm in human prehistory, few stateless societies exist today; almost the entire global population resides within the jurisdiction of a sovereign state.",politics
 In some regions nominal state authorities may be very weak and wield little or no actual power.,politics
 Over the course of history most stateless peoples have been integrated into the state-based societies around them.,politics
"Some political philosophies consider the state undesirable, and thus consider the formation of a stateless society a goal to be achieved.",politics
 A central tenet of anarchism is the advocacy of society without states.,politics
" The type of society sought for varies significantly between anarchist schools of thought, ranging from extreme individualism to complete collectivism.",politics
" In Marxism, Marx's theory of the state considers that in a post-capitalist society the state, an undesirable institution, would be unnecessary and wither away.",politics
" A related concept is that of stateless communism, a phrase sometimes used to describe Marx's anticipated post-capitalist society.",politics
Constitutions are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government.,politics
" Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution.",politics
 The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative and judiciary branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate.,politics
 England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the Civil War but after the Restoration abandoned them to be taken up later by the American Colonies after their emancipation and then France after the Revolution and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.,politics
"Constitutions often set out separation of powers, dividing the government into the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary (together referred to as the trias politica), in order to achieve checks and balances within the state.",politics
" Additional independent branches may also be created, including civil service commissions, election commissions, and supreme audit institutions.",politics
 Every political system is embedded in a particular political culture.,politics
" Lucian Pye's definition is that ""Political culture is the set of attitudes, beliefs, and sentiments, which give order and meaning to a political process and which provide the underlying assumptions and rules that govern behavior in the political system"".",politics
"Trust is a major factor in political culture, as its level determines the capacity of the state to function.",politics
" Postmaterialism is the degree to which a political culture is concerned with issues which are not of immediate physical or material concern, such as human rights and environmentalism.",politics
"Political corruption is the use of powers for illegitimate private gain, conducted by government officials or their network contacts.",politics
" Forms of political corruption include bribery, cronyism, nepotism, and political patronage.",politics
" Forms of political patronage, in turn, includes clientelism, earmarking, pork barreling, slush funds, and spoils systems; as well as political machines, which is a political system that operates for corrupt ends.",politics
"When corruption is embedded in political culture, this may be referred to as patrimonialism or neopatrimonialism.",politics
 A form of government that is built on corruption is called a kleptocracy ('rule of thieves').,politics
Political conflict entails the use of political violence to achieve political ends.,politics
" As noted by Carl von Clausewitz, ""War is a mere continuation of politics by other means.",politics
""" Beyond just inter-state warfare, this may include civil war; wars of national liberation; or asymmetric warfare, such as guerrilla war or terrorism.",politics
" When a political system is overthrown, the event is called a revolution: it is a political revolution if it does not go further; or a social revolution if the social system is also radically altered.",politics
Macropolitics can either describe political issues that affect an entire political system (e.,politics
" the nation state), or refer to interactions between political systems (e.",politics
"Global politics (or world politics) covers all aspects of politics that affect multiple political systems, in practice meaning any political phenomenon crossing national borders.",politics
" This can include cities, nation-states, multinational corporations, non-governmental organizations, and/or international organizations.",politics
" An important element is international relations: the relations between nation-states may be peaceful when they are conducted through diplomacy, or they may be violent, which is described as war.",politics
" States that are able to exert strong international influence are referred to as superpowers, whereas less-powerful ones may be called regional or middle powers.",politics
" The international system of power is called the world order, which is affected by the balance of power that defines the degree of polarity in the system.",politics
" Emerging powers are potentially destabilizing to it, especially if they display revanchism or irredentism.",politics
"Politics inside the limits of political systems, which in contemporary context correspond to national borders, are referred to as domestic politics.",politics
" This includes most forms of public policy, such as social policy, economic policy, or law enforcement, which are executed by the state bureaucracy.",politics
"Mesopolitics describes the politics of intermediary structures within a political system, such as national political parties or movements.",politics
"A political party is a political organization that typically seeks to attain and maintain political power within government, usually by participating in political campaigns, educational outreach, or protest actions.",politics
" Parties often espouse an expressed ideology or vision, bolstered by a written platform with specific goals, forming a coalition among disparate interests.",politics
"Political parties within a particular political system together form the party system, which can be either multiparty, two-party, dominant-party, or one-party, depending on the level of pluralism.",politics
" This is affected by characteristics of the political system, including its electoral system.",politics
" According to Duverger's law, first-past-the-post systems are likely to lead to two-party systems, while proportional representation systems are more likely to create a multiparty system.",politics
Micropolitics describes the actions of individual actors within the political system.,politics
"Democracy is a system of processing conflicts in which outcomes depend on what participants do, but no single force controls what occurs and its outcomes.",politics
 Democracy makes all forces struggle repeatedly to realize their interests and devolves power from groups of people to sets of rules.,politics
"Among modern political theorists, there are three contending conceptions of democracy: aggregative, deliberative, and radical.",politics
"The theory of aggregative democracy claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit the preferences of citizens, and aggregate them together to determine what social policies the society should adopt.",politics
" Therefore, proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on voting, where the policy with the most votes gets implemented.",politics
" Under minimalism, democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections.",politics
" According to this minimalist conception, citizens cannot and should not ""rule"" because, for example, on most issues, most of the time, they have no clear views or their views are not well-founded.",politics
" Joseph Schumpeter articulated this view most famously in his book Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy.",politics
"According to the theory of direct democracy, on the other hand, citizens should vote directly, not through their representatives, on legislative proposals.",politics
 Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view.,politics
" Political activity can be valuable in itself, it socializes and educates citizens, and popular participation can check powerful elites.",politics
" Most importantly, citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies.",politics
Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter—with half to their left and the other half to their right.,politics
 This is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of self-interested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes.,politics
 Anthony Downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments.,politics
 Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book An Economic Theory of Democracy.,politics
" Dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that, when it comes to binding collective decisions, each person in a political community is entitled to have his/her interests be given equal consideration (not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision).",politics
 He uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy.,politics
 First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society.,politics
" However, these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if, for example, poverty prevents political participation.",politics
" Similarly, Ronald Dworkin argues that ""democracy is a substantive, not a merely procedural, ideal.",politics
Deliberative democracy is based on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation.,politics
" Unlike aggregative democracy, deliberative democracy holds that, for a democratic decision to be legitimate, it must be preceded by authentic deliberation, not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting.",politics
" Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decision-makers that is free from distortions of unequal political power, such as power a decision-maker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups.",politics
" If the decision-makers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal, then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule.",politics
Radical democracy is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society.,politics
" Democracy's role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference, dissent and antagonisms in decision-making processes.",politics
"Equality is a state of affairs in which all people within a specific society or isolated group have the same social status, especially socioeconomic status, including protection of human rights and dignity, and equal access to certain social goods and social services.",politics
" Furthermore, it may also include health equality, economic equality and other social securities.",politics
 Social equality requires the absence of legally enforced social class or caste boundaries and the absence of discrimination motivated by an inalienable part of a person's identity.,politics
" To this end there must be equal justice under law, and equal opportunity regardless of, for example, sex, gender, ethnicity, age, sexual orientation, origin, caste or class, income or property, language, religion, convictions, opinions, health or disability.",politics
"A common way of understanding politics is through the left–right political spectrum, which ranges from left-wing politics via centrism to right-wing politics.",politics
" This classification is comparatively recent and dates from the French Revolution, when those members of the National Assembly who supported the republic, the common people and a secular society sat on the left and supporters of the monarchy, aristocratic privilege and the Church sat on the right.",politics
"Today, the left is generally progressivist, seeking social progress in society.",politics
" The more extreme elements of the left, named the far-left, tend to support revolutionary means for achieving this.",politics
" The center-left, on the other hand, advocate for more reformist approaches, for example that of social democracy.",politics
"In contrast, the right is generally motivated by conservatism, which seeks to conserve what it sees as the important elements of society.",politics
" The far-right goes beyond this, and often represents a reactionary turn against progress, seeking to undo it.",politics
 Examples of such ideologies have included Fascism and Nazism.,politics
" The center-right may be less clear-cut and more mixed in this regard, with neoconservatives supporting the spread of democracy, and one-nation conservatives more open to social welfare programs.",politics
"According to Norberto Bobbio, one of the major exponents of this distinction, the left believes in attempting to eradicate social inequality—believing it to be unethical or unnatural, while the right regards most social inequality as the result of ineradicable natural inequalities, and sees attempts to enforce social equality as utopian or authoritarian.",politics
"Some ideologies, notably Christian Democracy, claim to combine left and right-wing politics; according to Geoffrey K.",politics
" Roberts and Patricia Hogwood, ""In terms of ideology, Christian Democracy has incorporated many of the views held by liberals, conservatives and socialists within a wider framework of moral and Christian principles.",politics
""" Movements which claim or formerly claimed to be above the left-right divide include Fascist Terza Posizione economic politics in Italy and Peronism in Argentina.",politics
Political freedom (also known as political liberty or autonomy) is a central concept in political thought and one of the most important features of democratic societies.,politics
" Negative liberty has been described as freedom from oppression or coercion and unreasonable external constraints on action, often enacted through civil and political rights, while positive liberty is the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions, e.",politics
" This capability approach to freedom requires economic, social and cultural rights in order to be realized.",politics
Authoritarianism and libertarianism disagree the amount of individual freedom each person possesses in that society relative to the state.,politics
" One author describes authoritarian political systems as those where ""individual rights and goals are subjugated to group goals, expectations and conformities,"" while libertarians generally oppose the state and hold the individual as sovereign.",politics
" In their purest form, libertarians are anarchists, who argue for the total abolition of the state, of political parties and of other political entities, while the purest authoritarians are, by definition, totalitarians who support state control over all aspects of society.",politics
"For instance, classical liberalism (also known as laissez-faire liberalism) is a doctrine stressing individual freedom and limited government.",politics
" This includes the importance of human rationality, individual property rights, free markets, natural rights, the protection of civil liberties, constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of John Locke, Adam Smith, David Hume, David Ricardo, Voltaire, Montesquieu and others.",politics
" According to the libertarian Institute for Humane Studies, ""the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.",politics
" Susan Brown (1993), ""liberalism and anarchism are two political philosophies that are fundamentally concerned with individual freedom yet differ from one another in very distinct ways.",politics
 Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations.,politics

"A politician is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking an elected seat in government.",politics
"  Politicians propose, support, and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people.",politics
" Broadly speaking, a ""politician"" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in the government.",politics
"Politicians are people who are politically active, especially in party politics.",politics
" Positions range from local offices to executive, legislative, and judicial offices of regional and national governments.",politics
" Some elected law enforcement officers, such as sheriffs, are considered politicians.",politics
"Politicians are known for their rhetoric, as in speeches or campaign advertisements.",politics
 They are especially known for using common themes that allow them to develop their political positions in terms familiar to the voters.,politics
" Politicians in the 19th century made heavy use of newspapers, magazines, and pamphlets, as well as posters.",politics
" In the 20th century, they branched into radio and television, making television commercials the single most expensive part of an election campaign.",politics
" In the 21st century, they have become increasingly involved with the social media based on the Internet and smartphones.",politics
"Rumor has always played a major role in politics, with negative rumors about an opponent typically more effective than positive rumors about one's own side.",politics
"Once elected, the politician becomes a Head of Government and has to deal with government officials and government  employees.",politics
" Historically, there has been a subtle conflict between the long-term goals of each side.",politics
" In patronage-based systems, such as the United States and Canada in the 19th century, winning politicians replace the government officials and government employees under the civil services and defence services  with local politicians who formed their base of support, the ""spoils system"".",politics
 Public  Service reform was initiated to eliminate the corruption of civil services and defence services  that were involved.,politics
" However, in many less developed countries, the spoils system is in full-scale operation today.",politics
Mattozzi and Merlo argue that two main career paths are typically followed by politicians in modern democracies.,politics
 They are politicians who work in the political sector until retirement.,politics
" These are politicians who gain a reputation for expertise in controlling certain bureaucracies, then leave politics for a well-paid career in the private sector making use of their political contacts.",politics
"The personal histories of politicians have been frequently studied, as it is presumed that their experiences and characteristics shape their beliefs and behaviors.",politics
 There are four pathways by which a politician's biography could influence their leadership style and abilities.,politics
" The first is that biography may influence one's core beliefs, which are used to shape a worldview.",politics
 The second is that politicians' skills and competence are influenced by personal experience.,politics
 The areas of skill and competence can define where they devote resources and attention as a leader.,politics
 The third pathway is that biographical attributes may define and shape political incentives.,politics
" A leader's previous profession, for example, could be viewed as of higher importance, causing a disproportionate investment of leadership resources to ensure the growth and health of that profession, including former colleagues.",politics
" Other examples besides profession include the politician's innate characteristics, such as race or gender.",politics
" The fourth pathway is how a politician's biography affects their public perception, which can, in turn, affect their leadership style.",politics
" Female politicians, for example, may use different strategies to attract the same level of respect given to male politicians.",politics
"Numerous scholars have studied the characteristics of politicians, comparing those at the local and national levels, and comparing the more liberal or the more conservative ones, and comparing the more successful and less successful in terms of elections.",politics
" In recent years, special attention has focused on the distinctive career path of women politicians.",politics
" For example, there are studies of the ""Supermadre"" model in Latin American politics.",politics
"Many politicians have the knack to remember thousands of names and faces and recall personal anecdotes about their constituents—it is an advantage in the job, rather like being seven-foot tall for a basketball player.",politics
Many critics attack politicians for being out of touch with the public.,politics
" Areas of friction include how politicians speak, which has been described as being overly formal and filled with many euphemistic and metaphorical expressions and commonly perceived as an attempt to ""obscure, mislead, and confuse"".",politics
"In the popular image, politicians are thought of as clueless, selfish, manipulators, liars, incompetents, and corrupt, taking money in exchange for goods or services, rather than working for the general public good.",politics
" Politicians in many countries are regarded as the ""most hated professionals"".",politics
A democratic republic is a form of government operating on principles adopted from a republic and a democracy.,politics
" Rather than being a cross between two entirely separate systems, democratic republics may function on principles shared by both republics and democracies.",politics
"Common definitions of the terms democracy and republic often feature overlapping concerns, suggesting that many democracies function as republics, and many republics operate on democratic principles, as shown by these definitions from the Oxford English Dictionary:
",politics
"Republic: ""A state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives.",politics
"Democracy: ""A system of government by the whole population or all the eligible members of a state, typically through elected representatives.",politics
"""Eugene Volokh of the UCLA School of Law notes that the United States exemplifies the varied nature of a constitutional republic—a country where some decisions (often local) are made by direct democratic processes, while others (often federal) are made by democratically elected representatives.",politics
" As with many large systems, US governance is incompletely described by any single term.",politics
" It also employs the concept, for instance, of a constitutional democracy in which a court system is involved in matters of jurisprudence.",politics
"As with other democracies, not all persons in a democratic republic are necessarily citizens, and not all citizens are necessarily entitled to vote.",politics
 Suffrage is commonly restricted by criteria such as voting age.,politics
"In the US, the notion that a republic was a form of democracy was common from the time of its founding, and the concepts associated with representative democracy (and hence with a democratic republic) are suggested by John Adams (writing in 1784):No determinations are carried, it is true, in a simple representative democracy, but by consent of the majority or their representatives.",politics
"Historically, some inconsistency around the term is frequent.",politics
" The Republic of China (Taiwan) claims to be the oldest of Asia's democratic republics, though its recent history of democratic process is largely linked only to Taiwan.",politics
" Likewise, Africa's oldest democratic republic, Liberia (formed in 1822), has had its political stability rocked by periodic violence and coups.",politics
"Many countries that use the term ""democratic republic"" in their official names (such as Algeria, Congo-Kinshasa, Ethiopia, North Korea, Laos,  and Nepal) are considered undemocratic ""hybrid regimes"" or ""authoritarian regimes"" by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index and ""not free"" by the U.",politics

"In addition, East Germany was also officially known as the German Democratic Republic, but, like the Somali Democratic Republic, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was controlled by a bureaucratic government espousing Marxism–Leninism.",politics
" Incidentally, the Democratic Republic of Madagascar and the Democratic Republic of the Sudan were non-Marxist socialist dictatorships that existed during the Cold War.",politics
"There are also countries which use the term ""Democratic Republic"" in the name and have a good track of general election and were rated ""flawed democracy"" or ""full democracy"" in the Democracy Index, such as the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe and the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka.",politics
A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city.,politics
" Legislatures form important parts of the most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of parliamentary government.",politics
Laws enacted by legislatures are usually known as primary legislation.,politics
" In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, with authority to amend the budget involved.",politics
" In a democracy, legislators are most commonly popularly elected, although indirect election and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for bicameral legislatures featuring an upper chamber.",politics
The name used to refer to a legislative body varies by country.,politics
"Estates or States (from old French 'condition' or 'status')
",politics
"Parliament (from French parler 'to speak')Though the specific roles for each legislature differ by location, they all aim to serve the same purpose of appointing officials to represent their citizens to determine appropriate legislation for the country.",politics
Among the earliest recognised legislatures was the Athenian Ecclesia.,politics
" In the Middle Ages, European monarchs would host assemblies of the nobility, which would later develop into predecessors of modern legislatures.",politics
" The oldest surviving legislature is the Icelandic Althing, founded in 930 CE.",politics
"Democratic legislatures have six major functions: representation, deliberation, legislation, authorizing expenditure, making governments, and oversight.",politics
"There exist five ways that representation can be achieved in a legislature:
",politics
"Formalistically: how the rules of the legislature ensure representation of constituents;
",politics
"Symbolically: how the constituents perceive their representatives;
",politics
"Descriptively: how well the composition of the legislature matches the demographics of the wider society;
",politics
"Substantively: how well representatives actually respond to the needs of their constituents;
",politics
Collectively: how well the representatives represent the interests of the society as a whole.,politics
One of the major functions of a legislature is to discuss and debate issues of major importance to society.,politics
" In debating legislatures, like Parliament of the United Kingdom, there is lively debate on the floor of the legislature.",politics
" Contrastingly, in committee-based legislatures like the United States Congress, the deliberation takes place in closed committees.",politics
"While legislatures have nominally the sole power to create laws, the substantive extent of this power depends on details of the political system.",politics
" In Westminster-style legislatures the executive (composed of the cabinet) can essentially pass any laws it wants, as it usually has a majority of legislators behind it, kept in check by the party whip, while committee-based legislatures in continental Europe and those in presidential systems of the Americas have more independence in drafting and amending bills.",politics
The origins of the power of the purse which legislatures typically have in passing or denying government budgets goes back to the European assemblies of nobility which the monarchs would have to consult before raising taxes.,politics
" For this power to be actually effective, the legislature should be able to amend the budget, have an effective committee system, enough time for consideration, as well as access to relevant background information.",politics
The power of the legislature over the government is stronger.,politics
"There are several ways in which the legislature can hold the government accountable, including questioning, interpellations, and votes of confidence.",politics
"In contrast to democratic systems, legislatures under authoritarianism are used to ensure the stability of the power structure by co-opting potential competing interests within the elites, which they achieve (cap) by:
",politics
"Offering a way to recruit new members to the ruling clique;
",politics
Being a channel through which limited grievances and concessions can be passed.,politics
Each chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of parliamentary procedure to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation.,politics
 There must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities; this is called a quorum.,politics
"Some of the responsibilities of a legislature, such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation, are usually delegated to committees made up of a few of the members of the chamber(s).",politics
The members of a legislature usually represent different political parties; the members from each party generally meet as a caucus to organize their internal affairs.,politics
"Legislatures vary widely in the amount of political power they wield, compared to other political players such as judiciaries, militaries, and executives.",politics
 Steven Fish and Matthew Kroenig constructed a Parliamentary Powers Index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures.,politics
" The German Bundestag, the Italian Parliament, and the Mongolian State Great Khural tied for most powerful, while Myanmar's House of Representatives and Somalia's Transitional Federal Assembly (since replaced by the Federal Parliament of Somalia) tied for least powerful.",politics
"Some political systems follow the principle of legislative supremacy, which holds that the legislature is the supreme branch of government and cannot be bound by other institutions, such as the judicial branch or a written constitution.",politics
"In parliamentary and semi-presidential systems of government, the executive is responsible to the legislature, which may remove it with a vote of no confidence.",politics
" On the other hand, according to the separation of powers doctrine, the legislature in a presidential system is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the judiciary and the executive.",politics
" Nevertheless, many presidential systems provide for the impeachment of the executive for criminal or unconstitutional behaviour.",politics
Legislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to administrative or executive agencies.,politics
"Legislatures are made up of individual members, known as legislators, who vote on proposed laws.",politics
" A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of ""seats"" it contains.",politics
" For example, a legislature that has 100 ""seats"" has 100 members.",politics
" By extension, an electoral district that elects a single legislator can also be described as a ""seat"", as, for, example, in the phrases ""safe seat"" and ""marginal seat"".",politics
"After election, the members may be protected by parliamentary immunity or parliamentary privilege, either for all actions the duration of their entire term, or for just those related to their legislative duties.",politics
"A legislature may debate and vote upon bills as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate assemblies, called by various names including legislative chambers, debate chambers, and houses, which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers.",politics
" A legislature which operates as a single unit is unicameral, one divided into two chambers is bicameral, and one divided into three chambers is tricameral.",politics
"In bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the upper house, while the other is considered the lower house.",politics
" The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by administrative divisions rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house.",politics
" In some systems, particularly parliamentary systems, the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly federal presidential systems, the upper house has equal or even greater power.",politics
"In federations, the upper house typically represents the federation's component states.",politics
 This is also the case with the supranational legislature of the European Union.,politics
" The upper house may either contain the delegates of state governments – as in the European Union and in Germany and, before 1913, in the United States – or be elected according to a formula that grants equal representation to states with smaller populations, as is the case in Australia and the United States since 1913.",politics
"Tricameral legislatures are rare; the Massachusetts Governor's Council still exists, but the most recent national example existed in the waning years of White-minority rule in South Africa.",politics
" Tetracameral legislatures no longer exist, but they were previously used in Scandinavia.",politics
" Among national legislatures, China's National People's Congress is the largest with 2,980 members, while Vatican City's Pontifical Commission is the smallest with 7.",politics
 Neither legislature is democratically elected: The Pontifical Commission members are appointed by the Pope and the National People's Congress is indirectly elected within the context of a one-party state.,politics
"Legislature size is a trade off between efficiency and representation; the smaller the legislature, the more efficiently it can operate, but the larger the legislature, the better it can represent the political diversity of its constituents.",politics
" Comparative analysis of national legislatures has found that size of a country's lower house tends to be proportional to the cube root of its population; that is, the size of the lower house tends to increase along with population, but much more slowly.",politics
"In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative body of government.",politics
" Generally, a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government via hearings and inquiries.",politics
" The term is similar to the idea of a senate, synod or congress, and is commonly used in countries that are current or former monarchies, a form of government with a monarch as the head.",politics
" Some contexts restrict the use of the word parliament to parliamentary systems, although it is also used to describe the legislature in some presidential systems (e.",politics
" the Parliament of Ghana), even where it is not in the official name.",politics
"Historically, parliaments included various kinds of deliberative, consultative, and judicial assemblies, e.",politics
"The English term is derived from Anglo-Norman and dates to the 14th century, coming from the 11th century Old French parlement, from parler, meaning ""to talk"".",politics
" The meaning evolved over time, originally referring to any discussion, conversation, or negotiation through various kinds of deliberative or judicial groups, often summoned by a monarch.",politics
" By the 15th century, in Britain, it had come to specifically mean the legislature.",politics
"Since ancient times, when societies were tribal, there were councils or a headman whose decisions were assessed by village elders.",politics
 Some scholars suggest that in ancient Mesopotamia there was a primitive democratic government where the kings were assessed by council.,politics
" The same has been said about ancient India, where some form of deliberative assemblies existed, and therefore there was some form of democracy.",politics
" However, these claims are not accepted by most scholars, who see these forms of government as oligarchies.",politics
" The Athenian assembly (ἐκκλησία, ekklesia) was the most important institution, and every free male citizen could take part in the discussions.",politics
" However, Athenian democracy was not representative, but rather direct, and therefore the ekklesia was different from the parliamentary system.",politics
"The Roman Republic had legislative assemblies, who had the final say regarding the election of magistrates, the enactment of new statutes, the carrying out of capital punishment, the declaration of war and peace, and the creation (or dissolution) of alliances.",politics
" The Roman Senate controlled money, administration, and the details of foreign policy.",politics
Some Muslim scholars argue that the Islamic shura (a method of taking decisions in Islamic societies) is analogous to the parliament.,politics
" However, others highlight what they consider fundamental differences between the shura system and the parliamentary system.",politics
"Although there are documented councils held in 873, 1020, 1050 and 1063, there was no representation of commoners.",politics
" What is considered to be the first parliament (with the presence of commoners), the Cortes of León, was held in the Kingdom of León in 1188.",politics
" According to the UNESCO, the Decreta of Leon of 1188 is the oldest documentary manifestation of the European parliamentary system.",politics
" In addition, UNESCO granted the 1188 Cortes of Alfonso IX the title of ""Memory of the World"" and the city of Leon has been recognized as the ""Cradle of Parliamentarism"".",politics
"After coming to power, King Alfonso IX, facing an attack by his two neighbors, Castile and Portugal, decided to summon the ""Royal Curia"".",politics
" This was a medieval organization composed of aristocrats and bishops but because of the seriousness of the situation and the need to maximize political support, Alfonso IX took the decision to also call the representatives of the urban middle class from the most important cities of the kingdom to the assembly.",politics
" León's Cortes dealt with matters like the right to private property, the inviolability of domicile, the right to appeal to justice opposite the King and the obligation of the King to consult the Cortes before entering a war.",politics
" Prelates, nobles and commoners met separately in the three estates of the Cortes.",politics
" In this meeting, new laws were approved to protect commoners against the arbitrarities of nobles, prelates and the king.",politics
 This important set of laws is known as the Carta Magna Leonesa.,politics
"Following this event, new Cortes would appear in the other different territories that would make up Spain: Principality of Catalonia in 1192, the Kingdom of Castile in 1250, Kingdom of Aragon in 1274, Kingdom of Valencia in 1283 and Kingdom of Navarre in 1300.",politics
"After the union of the Kingdoms of Leon and Castile under the Crown of Castile, their Cortes were united as well in 1258.",politics
" The Castilian Cortes had representatives from Burgos, Toledo, León, Seville, Córdoba, Murcia, Jaén, Zamora, Segovia, Ávila, Salamanca, Cuenca, Toro, Valladolid, Soria, Madrid, Guadalajara and Granada (after 1492).",politics
"  The Cortes' assent was required to pass new taxes, and could also advise the king on other matters.",politics
"  The comunero rebels intended a stronger role for the Cortes, but were defeated by the forces of Habsburg Emperor Charles V in 1521.",politics
"  The Cortes maintained some power, however, though it became more of a consultative entity.",politics
"  However, by the time of King Philip II, Charles's son, the Castilian Cortes had come under functionally complete royal control, with its delegates dependent on the Crown for their income.",politics
The Cortes of the Crown of Aragon kingdoms retained their power to control the king's spending with regard to the finances of those kingdoms.,politics
" But after the War of the Spanish Succession and the victory of another royal house – the Bourbons – and King Philip V, their Cortes were suppressed (those of Aragon and Valencia in 1707, and those of Catalonia and the Balearic islands in 1714).",politics
"The very first Cortes representing the whole of Spain (and the Spanish empire of the day) assembled in 1812, in Cadiz, where it operated as a government in exile as at that time most of the rest of Spain was in the hands of Napoleon's army.",politics
"After its self-proclamation as an independent kingdom in 1139 by Afonso I of Portugal (followed by the recognition by the Kingdom of León in the Treaty of Zamora of 1143), the first historically established Cortes of the Kingdom of Portugal occurred in 1211 in Coimbra by initiative of Afonso II of Portugal.",politics
" These established the first general laws of the kingdom (Leis Gerais do Reino): protection of the king's property, stipulation of measures for the administration of justice and the rights of his subjects to be protected from abuses by royal officials, and confirming the clerical donations of the previous king Sancho I of Portugal.",politics
" These Cortes also affirmed the validity of canon law for the Church in Portugal, while introducing the prohibition of the purchase of lands by churches or monasteries (although they can be acquired by donations and legacies).",politics
"After the conquest of Algarve in 1249, the Kingdom of Portugal completed its Reconquista.",politics
" In 1254 King Afonso III of Portugal summoned Portuguese Cortes in Leiria, with the inclusion of burghers from old and newly incorporated municipalities.",politics
 This inclusion establishes the Cortes of Leiria of 1254 as the second sample of modern parliamentarism in the history of Europe (after the Cortes of León in 1188).,politics
 In these Cortes the monetagio was introduced: a fixed sum was to be paid by the burghers to the Crown as a substitute for the septennium (the traditional revision of the face value of coinage by the Crown every seven years).,politics
" These Cortes also introduced staple laws on the Douro River, favoring the new royal city of Vila Nova de Gaia at the expense of the old episcopal city of Porto.",politics
"The Portuguese Cortes met again under King Afonso III of Portugal in 1256, 1261 and 1273, always by royal summon.",politics
" Medieval Kings of Portugal continued to rely on small assemblies of notables, and only summoned the full Cortes on extraordinary occasions.",politics
" A Cortes would be called if the king wanted to introduce new taxes, change some fundamental laws, announce significant shifts in foreign policy (e.",politics
" ratify treaties), or settle matters of royal succession, issues where the cooperation and assent of the towns was thought necessary.",politics
" Changing taxation (especially requesting war subsidies), was probably the most frequent reason for convening the Cortes.",politics
" As the nobles and clergy were largely tax-exempt, setting taxation involved intensive negotiations between the royal council and the burgher delegates at the Cortes.",politics
"Delegates (procuradores) not only considered the king's proposals, but, in turn, also used the Cortes to submit petitions of their own to the royal council on a myriad of matters, e.",politics
" extending and confirming town privileges, punishing abuses of officials, introducing new price controls, constraints on Jews, pledges on coinage, etc.",politics
" The royal response to these petitions became enshrined as ordinances and statutes, thus giving the Cortes the aspect of a legislature.",politics
 These petitions were originally referred to as aggravamentos (grievances) then artigos (articles) and eventually capitulos (chapters).,politics
" In a Cortes-Gerais, petitions were discussed and voted upon separately by each estate and required the approval of at least two of the three estates before being passed up to the royal council.",politics
 The proposal was then subject to royal veto (either accepted or rejected by the king in its entirety) before becoming law.,politics
"Nonetheless, the exact extent of Cortes power was ambiguous.",politics
 Kings insisted on their ancient prerogative to promulgate laws independently of the Cortes.,politics
" The compromise, in theory, was that ordinances enacted in Cortes could only be modified or repealed by Cortes.",politics
 But even that principle was often circumvented or ignored in practice.,politics
"The Cortes probably had their heyday in the 14th and 15th centuries, reaching their apex when John I of Portugal relied almost wholly upon the bourgeoisie for his power.",politics
" For a period after the 1383–1385 Crisis, the Cortes were convened almost annually.",politics
" Portuguese monarchs, tapping into the riches of the Portuguese empire overseas, grew less dependent on Cortes subsidies and convened them less frequently.",politics
"1481-1495) used them to break the high nobility, but dispensed with them otherwise.",politics
"Curiously, the Cortes gained a new importance with the Iberian Union of 1581, finding a role as the representative of Portuguese interests to the new Habsburg monarch.",politics
" The Cortes played a critical role in the 1640 Restoration, and enjoyed a brief period of resurgence during the reign of John IV of Portugal (r.",politics
" But by the end of the 17th century, it found itself sidelined once again.",politics
" The last Cortes met in 1698, for the mere formality of confirming the appointment of Infante John (future John V of Portugal) as the successor of Peter II of Portugal.",politics
" Thereafter, Portuguese kings ruled as absolute monarchs and no Cortes were assembled for over a century.",politics
" This state of affairs came to an end with the Liberal Revolution of 1820, which set in motion the introduction of a new constitution, and a permanent and proper parliament, that however inherited the name of Cortes Gerais.",politics
England has long had a tradition of a body of men who would assist and advise the king on important matters.,politics
" Under the Anglo-Saxon kings, there was an advisory council, the Witenagemot.",politics
" The name derives from the Old English ƿitena ȝemōt, or witena gemōt, for ""meeting of wise men"".",politics
 The first recorded act of a witenagemot was the law code issued by King Æthelberht of Kent ca.,politics
" 600, the earliest document which survives in sustained Old English prose; however, the witan was certainly in existence long before this time.",politics
" The Witan, along with the folkmoots (local assemblies), is an important ancestor of the modern English parliament.",politics
"As part of the Norman Conquest, the new king, William I, did away with the Witenagemot, replacing it with a Curia Regis (""King's Council"").",politics
" Membership of the Curia was largely restricted to the tenants in chief, the few nobles who ""rented"" great estates directly from the king, along with ecclesiastics.",politics
" William brought to England the feudal system of his native Normandy, and sought the advice of the curia regis before making laws.",politics
" This is the original body from which the Parliament, the higher courts of law, and the Privy Council and Cabinet descend.",politics
" Of these, the legislature is formally the High Court of Parliament; judges sit in the Supreme Court of Judicature.",politics
 Only the executive government is no longer conducted in a royal court.,politics
Most historians date the emergence of a parliament with some degree of power to which the throne had to defer no later than the rule of Edward I.,politics
"  Like previous kings, Edward called leading nobles and church leaders to discuss government matters, especially finance and taxation.",politics
 A meeting in 1295 became known as the Model Parliament because it set the pattern for later Parliaments.,politics
" The significant difference between the Model Parliament and the earlier Curia Regis was the addition of the Commons; that is, the inclusion of elected representatives of rural landowners and of townsmen.",politics
" In 1307, Edward I agreed not to collect certain taxes without the ""consent of the realm"" through parliament.",politics
The tenants-in-chief often struggled with their spiritual counterparts and with the king for power.,politics
" In 1215, they secured from King John of England Magna Carta, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of a council.",politics
" It was also established that the most important tenants-in-chief and ecclesiastics be summoned to the council by personal writs from the sovereign, and that all others be summoned to the council by general writs from the sheriffs of their counties.",politics
 Modern government has its origins in the Curia Regis; parliament descends from the Great Council later known as the parliamentum established by Magna Carta.,politics
"During the reign of King Henry III, 13th-Century English Parliaments incorporated elected representatives from shires and towns.",politics
" These parliaments are, as such, considered forerunners of the modern parliament.",politics
"In 1265, Simon de Montfort, then in rebellion against Henry III, summoned a parliament of his supporters without royal authorization.",politics
" The archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and barons were summoned, as were two knights from each shire and two burgesses from each borough.",politics
" Knights had been summoned to previous councils, but it was unprecedented for the boroughs to receive any representation.",politics
" Come 1295, Edward I later adopted de Montfort's ideas for representation and election in the so-called ""Model Parliament"".",politics
" At first, each estate debated independently; by the reign of Edward III, however, Parliament recognisably assumed its modern form, with authorities dividing the legislative body into two separate chambers.",politics
The purpose and structure of Parliament in Tudor England underwent a significant transformation under the reign of Henry VIII.,politics
" Originally its methods were primarily medieval, and the monarch still possessed a form of inarguable dominion over its decisions.",politics
" According to Elton, it was Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex, then chief minister to Henry VIII, who initiated still other changes within parliament.",politics
The Reformation Acts supplied Parliament with unlimited power over the country.,politics
" This included authority over virtually every matter, whether social, economic, political, or religious; it legalised the Reformation, officially and indisputably.",politics
" The king had to rule through the council, not over it, and all sides needed to reach a mutual agreement when creating or passing laws, adjusting or implementing taxes, or changing religious doctrines.",politics
 This was significant: the monarch no longer had sole control over the country.,politics
" For instance, during the later years of Mary, Parliament exercised its authority in originally rejecting Mary's bid to revive Catholicism in the realm.",politics
" Later on, the legislative body even denied Elizabeth her request to marry.",politics
" If Parliament had possessed this power before Cromwell, such as when Wolsey served as secretary, the Reformation may never have happened, as the king would have had to gain the consent of all parliament members before so drastically changing the country's religious laws and fundamental identity.",politics
The power of Parliament increased considerably after the Civil War.,politics
" More stability, in turn, helped assure more effective management, organisation, and efficiency.",politics
 Parliament printed statutes and devised a more coherent parliamentary procedure.,politics
The rise of Parliament proved especially important in the sense that it limited the repercussions of dynastic complications that had so often plunged England into civil war.,politics
" Parliament still ran the country even in the absence of suitable heirs to the throne, and its legitimacy as a decision-making body reduced the royal prerogatives of kings like Henry VIII and the importance of their whims.",politics
" For example, Henry VIII could not simply establish supremacy by proclamation; he required Parliament to enforce statutes and add felonies and treasons.",politics
 An important liberty for Parliament was its freedom of speech; Henry allowed anything to be spoken openly within Parliament and speakers could not face arrest – a fact which they exploited incessantly.,politics
" Nevertheless, Parliament in Henry VIII's time offered up very little objection to the monarch's desires.",politics
" Under his and Edward's reign, the legislative body complied willingly with the majority of the kings' decisions.",politics
Much of this compliance stemmed from how the English viewed and traditionally understood authority.,politics
" As Williams described it, ""King and parliament were not separate entities, but a single body, of which the monarch was the senior partner and the Lords and the Commons the lesser, but still essential, members.",politics
"Although its role in government expanded significantly during the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, the Parliament of England saw some of its most important gains in the 17th century.",politics
 A series of conflicts between the Crown and Parliament culminated in the execution of King Charles I in 1649.,politics
" Afterward, England became a commonwealth, with Oliver Cromwell, its lord protector, the de facto ruler.",politics
" Frustrated with its decisions, Cromwell purged and suspended Parliament on several occasions.",politics
"A controversial figure accused of despotism, war crimes, and even genocide, Cromwell is nonetheless regarded as essential to the growth of democracy in England.",politics
" The years of the Commonwealth, coupled with the restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the subsequent Glorious Revolution of 1688, helped reinforce and strengthen Parliament as an institution separate from the Crown.",politics
The Parliament of England met until it merged with the Parliament of Scotland under the Acts of Union.,politics
 This union created the new Parliament of Great Britain in 1707.,politics
"From the 10th century the Kingdom of Alba was ruled by chiefs (toisechs) and subkings (mormaers) under the suzerainty, real or nominal, of a High King.",politics
" Popular assemblies, as in Ireland, were involved in law-making, and sometimes in king-making, although the introduction of tanistry—naming a successor in the lifetime of a king—made the second less than common.",politics
" These early assemblies cannot be considered ""parliaments"" in the later sense of the word, and were entirely separate from the later, Norman-influenced, institution.",politics
The Parliament of Scotland evolved during the Middle Ages from the King's Council of Bishops and Earls.,politics
" The unicameral parliament is first found on record, referred to as a colloquium, in 1235 at Kirkliston (a village now in Edinburgh).",politics
"By the early fourteenth century the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 burgh commissioners attended.",politics
" Consisting of the Three Estates; of clerics, lay tenants-in-chief and burgh commissioners sitting in a single chamber, the Scottish parliament acquired significant powers over particular issues.",politics
" Most obviously it was needed for consent for taxation (although taxation was only raised irregularly in Scotland in the medieval period), but it also had a strong influence over justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation, whether political, ecclesiastical, social or economic.",politics
" Parliamentary business was also carried out by ""sister"" institutions, before c.",politics
 1500 by General Council and thereafter by the Convention of Estates.,politics
" These could carry out much business also dealt with by Parliament – taxation, legislation and policy-making – but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament.",politics
"The parliament, which is also referred to as the Estates of Scotland, the Three Estates, the Scots Parliament or the auld Scots Parliament (Eng: old), met until the Acts of Union merged the Parliament of Scotland and the Parliament of England, creating the new Parliament of Great Britain in 1707.",politics
"Following the 1997 Scottish devolution referendum, and the passing of the Scotland Act 1998 by the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament was reconvened on 1 July 1999, although with much more limited powers than its 18th-century predecessor.",politics
" The parliament has sat since 2004 at its newly constructed Scottish Parliament Building in Edinburgh, situated at the foot of the Royal Mile, next to the royal palace of Holyroodhouse.",politics
"A thing or ting (Old Norse and Icelandic: þing; other modern Scandinavian: ting, ding in Dutch) was the governing assembly in Germanic societies, made up of the free men of the community and presided by lawspeakers.",politics
"The thing was the assembly of the free men of a country, province or a hundred (hundare/härad/herred).",politics
" There were consequently, hierarchies of things, so that the local things were represented at the thing for a larger area, for a province or land.",politics
" At the thing, disputes were solved and political decisions were made.",politics
 The place for the thing was often also the place for public religious rites and for commerce.,politics
"The thing met at regular intervals, legislated, elected chieftains and kings, and judged according to the law, which was memorised and recited by the ""law speaker"" (the judge).",politics
"The Icelandic, Faroese and Manx parliaments trace their origins back to the Viking expansion originating from the Petty kingdoms of Norway as well as Denmark, replicating Viking government systems in the conquered territories, such as those represented by the Gulating near Bergen in western Norway.",politics
"Later national diets with chambers for different estates developed, e.",politics
" in Sweden and in Finland (which was part of Sweden until 1809), each with a House of Knights for the nobility.",politics
" In both these countries, the national parliaments are now called riksdag (in Finland also eduskunta), a word used since the Middle Ages and equivalent of the German word Reichstag.",politics
"Today the term lives on in the official names of national legislatures, political and judicial institutions in the North-Germanic countries.",politics
" In the Yorkshire and former Danelaw areas of England, which were subject to much Norse invasion and settlement, the wapentake was another name for the same institution.",politics
"The Sicilian Parliament, dating to 1097, evolved as the legislature of the Kingdom of Sicily.",politics
"The Federal Diet of Switzerland was one of the longest-lived representative bodies in history, continuing from the 13th century to 1848.",politics
"Originally, there was only the Parliament of Paris, born out of the Curia Regis in 1307, and located inside the medieval royal palace, now the Paris Hall of Justice.",politics
 The jurisdiction of the Parliament of Paris covered the entire kingdom.,politics
" In 1443, following the turmoil of the Hundred Years' War, King Charles VII of France granted Languedoc its own parliament by establishing the Parliament of Toulouse, the first parliament outside of Paris, whose jurisdiction extended over the most part of southern France.",politics
" From 1443 until the French Revolution several other parliaments were created in some provinces of France (Grenoble, Bordeaux).",politics
All the parliaments could issue regulatory decrees for the application of royal edicts or of customary practices; they could also refuse to register laws that they judged contrary to fundamental law or simply as being untimely.,politics
" Parliamentary power in France was suppressed more so than in England as a result of absolutism, and parliaments were eventually overshadowed by the larger Estates General, up until the French Revolution, when the National Assembly became the lower house of France's bicameral legislature.",politics
"The  Diet of Hungary or originally: Parlamentum Publicum / Parlamentum Generale (Hungarian: Országgyűlés) became the supreme legislative institution in the medieval kingdom of Hungary from the 1290s, and in its successor states, Royal Hungary and the Habsburg kingdom of Hungary throughout the Early Modern period.",politics
" The name of the legislative body was originally ""Parlamentum"" during the Middle Ages, the ""Diet"" expression gained mostly in the Early Modern period.",politics
" It convened at regular intervals with interruptions during the period of 1527 to 1918, and again until 1946.",politics
Some researchers have traced the roots of the Hungarian institution of national assemblies as far back as the 11th century.,politics
" This based on documentary evidence that, on certain ""important occasions"" under the reigns of King Ladislaus I and King Coloman ""the Learned"", assemblies were held on a national scale where both ecclesiastic and secular dignitaries made appearances.",politics
"The first exact written mention of the word ""parlamentum"" (Parliament) for the nation-wide assembly originated during the reign of King Andrew II in the Golden Bull of 1222, which reaffirmed the rights of the smaller nobles of the old and new classes of royal servants (servientes regis) against both the crown and the magnates, and to defend the rights of the whole nation against the crown by restricting the powers of the latter in certain fields and legalizing refusal to obey its unlawful/unconstitutional commands (the ""ius resistendi"").",politics
"The lesser nobles also began to present Andrew with grievances, a practice that evolved into the institution of the Hungarian Diet.",politics
An institutionalized Hungarian parliament emerged during the 14th and 15th centuries.,politics
" Beginning under King Charles I, continuing under subsequent kings through into the reign of King Matthias I, the Diet was essentially convened by the king.",politics
" However, under the rule of heavy handed kings like Louis the Great and during reign of the early absolutist Matthias Corvinus the parliaments were often convened to announce the royal decisions, and had no significant power of its own.",politics
" Since the reign of the Jagiellonian dynasty, the parliament has regained most of its former power.",politics
"According to the Chronicles of Gallus Anonymus, the first legendary Polish ruler, Siemowit, who began the Piast Dynasty, was chosen by a wiec.",politics
" The veche (Russian: вече, Polish: wiec) was a popular assembly in medieval Slavic countries, and in late medieval period, a parliament.",politics
" The idea of the wiec led in 1182 to the development of the Polish parliament, the Sejm.",politics
"The term ""sejm"" comes from an old Polish expression denoting a meeting of the populace.",politics
" The power of early sejms grew between 1146–1295, when the power of individual rulers waned and various councils and wiece grew stronger.",politics
" Since the 14th century irregular sejms (described in various Latin sources as contentio generalis, conventio magna, conventio solemna, parlamentum, parlamentum generale, dieta or Polish sejm walny) have been called by Polish kings.",politics
" From 1374, the king had to receive sejm permission to raise taxes.",politics
" The General Sejm (Polish Sejm Generalny or Sejm Walny), first convoked by the king John I Olbracht in 1493 near Piotrków, evolved from earlier regional and provincial meetings (sejmiks).",politics
" It followed most closely the sejmik generally, which arose from the 1454 Nieszawa Statutes, granted to the szlachta (nobles) by King Casimir IV the Jagiellonian.",politics
" From 1493 forward, indirect elections were repeated every two years.",politics
 With the development of the unique Polish Golden Liberty the Sejm's powers increased.,politics
 Poland was among the few countries in Europe where the parliament played an especially important role - it was the Sejm that contributed the most to uniting the nation and the state.,politics
"The Commonwealth's general parliament consisted of three estates: the King of Poland (who also acted as the Grand Duke of Lithuania, Russia/Ruthenia, Prussia, Mazovia, etc.",politics
"), the Senat (consisting of Ministers, Palatines, Castellans and Bishops) and the Chamber of Envoys—circa 170 nobles (szlachta) acting on behalf of their Lands and sent by Land Parliaments.",politics
 Also representatives of selected cities but without any voting powers.,politics
 Since 1573 at a royal election all peers of the Commonwealth could participate in the Parliament and become the King's electors.,politics
Cossack Rada was the legislative body of a military republic of the Ukrainian Cossacks that grew rapidly in the 15th century from serfs fleeing the more controlled parts of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth.,politics
 The republic did not regard social origin/nobility and accepted all people who declared to be Orthodox Christians.,politics
"Originally established at the Zaporizhian Sich, the rada (council) was an institution of Cossack administration in Ukraine from the 16th to the 18th century.",politics
" With the establishment of the Hetman state in 1648, it was officially known as the General Military Council until 1750.",politics
"The zemsky sobor (Russian: зе́мский собо́р) was the first Russian parliament of the feudal Estates type, in the 16th and 17th centuries.",politics
"It could be summoned either by tsar, or patriarch, or the Boyar Duma.",politics
" Three categories of population, comparable to the Estates-General of France but with the numbering of the first two Estates reversed, participated in the assembly:
",politics
"Nobility and high bureaucracy, including the Boyar DumaThe Holy Sobor of high Orthodox clergyRepresentatives of merchants and townspeople (third estate)The name of the parliament of nowadays Russian Federation is the Federal Assembly of Russia.",politics
" The term for its lower house, State Duma (which is better known than the Federal Assembly itself, and is often mistaken for the entirety of the parliament) comes from the Russian word думать (dumat),  ""to think"".",politics
 The Boyar Duma was an advisory council to the grand princes and tsars of Muscovy.,politics
" The Duma was discontinued by Peter the Great, who transferred its functions to the Governing Senate in 1711.",politics
The veche was the highest legislature and judicial authority in the republic of Novgorod until 1478.,politics
" In its sister state, Pskov, a separate veche operated until 1510.",politics
"Since the Novgorod revolution of 1137 ousted the ruling grand prince, the veche became the supreme state authority.",politics
" After the reforms of 1410, the veche was restructured on a model similar to that of Venice, becoming the Commons chamber of the parliament.",politics
" An upper Senate-like Council of Lords was also created, with title membership for all former city magistrates.",politics
" Some sources indicate that veche membership may have become full-time, and parliament deputies were now called vechniks.",politics
"  It is recounted that the Novgorod assembly could be summoned by anyone who rung the veche bell, although it is more likely that the common procedure was more complex.",politics
 This bell was a symbol of republican sovereignty and independence.,politics
" The whole population of the city—boyars, merchants, and common citizens—then gathered at Yaroslav's Court.",politics
 Separate assemblies could be held in the districts of Novgorod.,politics
 In Pskov the veche assembled in the court of the Trinity cathedral.,politics
"""Conciliarism"" or the ""conciliar movement"", was a reform movement in the 14th and 15th century Roman Catholic Church which held that final authority in spiritual matters resided with the Roman Church as corporation of Christians, embodied by a general church council, not with the pope.",politics
" In effect, the movement sought – ultimately, in vain – to create an All-Catholic Parliament.",politics
 Its struggle with the Papacy had many points in common with the struggle of parliaments in specific countries against the authority of Kings and other secular rulers.,politics
The development of the modern concept of parliamentary government dates back to the Kingdom of Great Britain (1707–1800).,politics
"The British Parliament is often referred to as the Mother of Parliaments (in fact a misquotation of John Bright, who remarked in 1865 that ""England is the Mother of Parliaments"") because the British Parliament has been the model for most other parliamentary systems, and its Acts have created many other parliaments.",politics
" Many nations with parliaments have to some degree emulated the British ""three-tier"" model known as the Westminster system.",politics
" Most countries in Europe and the Commonwealth have similarly organised parliaments with a largely ceremonial head of state who formally opens and closes parliament, a large elected lower house and a smaller, upper house.",politics
The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 by the Acts of Union that replaced the former parliaments of England and Scotland.,politics
 A further union in 1801 united the Parliament of Great Britain and the Parliament of Ireland into a Parliament of the United Kingdom.,politics
"In the United Kingdom, Parliament consists of the House of Commons, the House of Lords, and the Monarch.",politics
 The House of Commons is composed of 650 (soon to be 600) members who are directly elected by British citizens to represent single-member constituencies.,politics
" The leader of a Party that wins more than half the seats, or less than half but is able to gain the support of smaller parties to achieve a majority in the house is invited by the Monarch to form a government.",politics
" The House of Lords is a body of long-serving, unelected members: Lords Temporal – 92 of whom inherit their titles (and of whom 90 are elected internally by members of the House to lifetime seats), 588 of whom have been appointed to lifetime seats, and Lords Spiritual – 26 bishops, who are part of the house while they remain in office.",politics
Legislation can originate from either the Lords or the Commons.,politics
" It is voted on in several distinct stages, called readings, in each house.",politics
 Third reading is detailed consideration of clauses of the bill.,politics
In addition to the three readings a bill also goes through a committee stage where it is considered in great detail.,politics
 Once the bill has been passed by one house it goes to the other and essentially repeats the process.,politics
 If after the two sets of readings there are disagreements between the versions that the two houses passed it is returned to the first house for consideration of the amendments made by the second.,politics
 If it passes through the amendment stage Royal Assent is granted and the bill becomes law as an Act of Parliament.,politics
The House of Lords is the less powerful of the two houses as a result of the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949.,politics
 These Acts removed the veto power of the Lords over a great deal of legislation.,politics
 If a bill is certified by the Speaker of the House of Commons as a money bill (i.,politics
 acts raising taxes and similar) then the Lords can only block it for a month.,politics
 If an ordinary bill originates in the Commons the Lords can only block it for a maximum of one session of Parliament.,politics
 The exceptions to this rule are things like bills to prolong the life of a Parliament beyond five years.,politics
"In addition to functioning as the second chamber of Parliament, the House of Lords was also the final court of appeal for much of the law of the United Kingdom—a combination of judicial and legislative function that recalls its origin in the Curia Regis.",politics
 This changed in October 2009 when the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom opened and acquired the former jurisdiction of the House of Lords.,politics
"Since 1999, there has been a Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh, and, since 2020, a Senedd—or Welsh Parliament—in Cardiff.",politics
" However, these national, unicameral legislatures do not have complete power over their respective countries of the United Kingdom, holding only those powers devolved to them by Westminster from 1997.",politics
" They cannot legislate on defence issues, currency, or national taxation (e.",politics
" Additionally, the bodies can be theoretically dissolved, at any given time, by the British Parliament without the consent of the devolved government.",politics
"In Sweden, the half-century period of parliamentary government beginning with Charles XII's death in 1718 and ending with Gustav III's self-coup in 1772 is known as the Age of Liberty.",politics
" During this period, civil rights were expanded and power shifted from the monarch to parliament.",politics
"While suffrage did not become universal, the taxed peasantry was represented in Parliament, although with little influence and commoners without taxed property had no suffrage at all.",politics
Changes in Poland’s internal situation in the 1980s led to the Round Table Talks which ended in the signing of the famous Round Table Agreement on 5 April 1989.,politics
 The Agreement spearheaded the evolutionary transformation of the country’s political system; independence was regained once again.,politics
 The document Position on Political Reforms provided grounds for amending the Constitution.,politics
 The amended Constitution restored the office of the President of the Polish People’s Republic and the Senate – both to be elected in free and democratic elections.,politics
" In the Sejm, the opposition was allocated 35% of the mandates.",politics
 Thus the so called “contract” elections could not be fully democratic.,politics
 The Sejm (first chamber) became superior to the Senate (second chamber).,politics
" In addition, the institution of National Assembly was established, consisting of the Sejm and the Senate sitting jointly to elect the President of the Polish People’s Republic.",politics
" A declaration of the Solidarity Citizens’ Committee heralded the prompt enactment of a new, democratic constitution and electoral law.",politics
" As a result of Solidarity’s success in elections to the Sejm and the Senate, profound reforms of the political system were undertaken by adopting an amendment to the Constitution on 29 December 1989.",politics
" In the Constitution, the Republic of Poland was defined as a democratic state ruled by law.",politics
" As the provisional constitution lasted too long, it was decided to adopt a provisional regulation in the form of the so called Small Constitution.",politics
" The Small Constitution regulated above all the relationship between the executive and legislative powers, on the basis of the doctrine of separation of powers.",politics
"After long years of legislative work, on 2 April 1997, the National Assembly adopted The Constitution of the Republic of Poland.",politics
 The new Constitution introduced a “rationalised” parliamentary-cabinet system in Poland.,politics
 The act defined the position of the Sejm and the Senate within the system without using the term “parliament”.,politics
" It adopted the doctrine of separation of powers, which provided for a balance between the legislative and executive powers.",politics
 In practice the binding provisions of the Constitution ensure the supremacy of the legislative power.,politics
" Both chambers are autonomous bodies, independent of each other, with their own powers.",politics
 The Constitution retained the principle of bicameralism of the legislature.,politics
 The Sejm and the Senate sitting jointly constitute the National Assembly.,politics
" Characteristically, the new Constitution conferred very extensive powers on the Sejm.",politics
" On the other hand, the powers of the Senate are limited, as in the Constitutions of 1921 and 1992.",politics
"Many parliaments are part of a parliamentary system of government, in which the executive is constitutionally answerable to the parliament.",politics
" Some restrict the use of the word parliament to parliamentary systems, while others use the word for any elected legislative body.",politics
" Parliaments usually consist of chambers or houses, and are usually either bicameral or unicameral although more complex models exist, or have existed (see Tricameralism).",politics
"In some parliamentary systems, the prime minister is a member of the parliament (e.",politics
" They are commonly the leader of the majority party in the lower house of parliament, but only hold the office as long as the ""confidence of the house"" is maintained.",politics
" If members of the lower house lose faith in the leader for whatever reason, they can call a vote of no confidence and force the prime minister to resign.",politics
"This can be particularly dangerous to a government when the distribution of seats among different parties is relatively even, in which case a new election is often called shortly thereafter.",politics
" However, in case of general discontent with the head of government, their replacement can be made very smoothly without all the complications that it represents in the case of a presidential system.",politics
"The parliamentary system can be contrasted with a presidential system, such as the American congressional system, which operates under a stricter separation of powers, whereby the executive does not form part of, nor is it appointed by, the parliamentary or legislative body.",politics
" In such a system, congresses do not select or dismiss heads of governments, and governments cannot request an early dissolution as may be the case for parliaments.",politics
" Some states, such as France, have a semi-presidential system which falls between parliamentary and congressional systems, combining a powerful head of state (president) with a head of government, the prime minister, who is responsible to parliament.",politics

An election is a formal group decision-making process by which a population chooses an individual or multiple individuals to hold public office.,politics
Elections have been the usual mechanism by which modern representative democracy has operated since the 17th century.,politics
" Elections may fill offices in the legislature, sometimes in the executive and judiciary, and for regional and local government.",politics
" This process is also used in many other private and business organisations, from clubs to voluntary associations and corporations.",politics
"The universal use of elections as a tool for selecting representatives in modern representative democracies is in contrast with the practice in the democratic archetype, ancient Athens, where the Elections were not used were considered an oligarchic institution and most political offices were filled using sortition, also known as allotment, by which officeholders were chosen by lot.",politics
"Electoral reform describes the process of introducing fair electoral systems where they are not in place, or improving the fairness or effectiveness of existing systems.",politics
 Psephology is the study of results and other statistics relating to elections (especially with a view to predicting future results).,politics
"To elect means ""to select or make a decision"", and so sometimes other forms of ballot such as referendums are referred to as elections, especially in the United States.",politics
"Elections were used as early in history as ancient Greece and ancient Rome, and throughout the Medieval period to select rulers such as the Holy Roman Emperor (see imperial election) and the pope (see papal election).",politics
"In Vedic period of India, the Raja (chiefs) of a gaṇa (a tribal organization) was apparently elected by the gana.",politics
" The Raja always belonged to the Kshatriya varna (warrior class), and was typically a son of the previous Raja.",politics
" However, the gana members had the final say in his elections.",politics
 Even during the Sangam Period people elected their representatives by casting their votes and the ballot boxes (Usually a pot) were tied by rope and sealed.,politics

 Such elections were quite common in contemporary societies of the region.,politics
" In the Chola Empire, around 920 CE, in Uthiramerur (in present-day Tamil Nadu), palm leaves were used for selecting the village committee members.",politics
" The leaves, with candidate names written on them, were put inside a mud pot.",politics
" To select the committee members, a young boy was asked to take out as many leaves as the number of positions available.",politics
"The first recorded popular elections of officials to public office, by majority vote, where all citizens were eligible both to vote and to hold public office, date back to the Ephors of Sparta in 754 B.",politics
" Athenian democratic elections, where all citizens could hold public office, were not introduced for another 247 years, until the reforms of Cleisthenes.",politics
"), all Athenian citizens were eligible to vote in the popular assemblies, on matters of law and policy, and as jurors, but only the three highest classes of citizens could vote in elections.",politics
" Nor were the lowest of the four classes of Athenian citizens (as defined by the extent of their wealth and property, rather than by birth) eligible to hold public office, through the reforms of Solon.",politics
" The Spartan election of the Ephors, therefore, also predates the reforms of Solon in Athens by approximately 180 years.",politics
"Questions of suffrage, especially suffrage for minority groups, have dominated the history of elections.",politics
" Males, the dominant cultural group in North America and Europe, often dominated the electorate and continue to do so in many countries.",politics
 Early elections in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States were dominated by landed or ruling class males.,politics
" However, by 1920 all Western European and North American democracies had universal adult male suffrage (except Switzerland) and many countries began to consider women's suffrage.",politics
" Despite legally mandated universal suffrage for adult males, political barriers were sometimes erected to prevent fair access to elections (see civil rights movement).",politics
The question of who may vote is a central issue in elections.,politics
" The electorate does not generally include the entire population; for example, many countries prohibit those who are under the age of majority from voting, all jurisdictions require a minimum age for voting.",politics
"In Australia, Aboriginal people were not given the right to vote until 1962 (see 1967 referendum entry) and in 2010 the federal government removed the rights of prisoners serving for 3 years or more to vote (a large proportion of which were Aboriginal Australians).",politics
"Suffrage is typically only for citizens of the country, though further limits may be imposed.",politics
"However, in the European Union, one can vote in municipal elections if one lives in the municipality and is an EU citizen; the nationality of the country of residence is not required.",politics
"In some countries, voting is required by law; if an eligible voter does not cast a vote, he or she may be subject to punitive measures such as a fine.",politics
" In Western Australia, the penalty for a first time offender failing to vote is a $20.",politics
"Historically the size of eligible voters, the electorate, was small having the size of groups or communities of privileged men like aristocrats and men of a city (citizens).",politics
"With the growth of the number of people with bourgeois citizen rights outside of cities, expanding the term citizen, the electorates grew to numbers beyond the thousands.",politics
"Elections with an electorate in the hundred thousands appeared in the final decades of the Roman Republic, by extending voting rights to citizens outside of Rome with the Lex Julia of 90 BC, reaching an electorate of 910,000 and estimated voter turnout of maximum 10% in 70 BC, only again comparable in size to the first elections of the United States.",politics
" At the same time the Kingdom of Great Britain had in 1780 about 214,000 eligible voters, 3% of the whole population.",politics
A representative democracy requires a procedure to govern nomination for political office.,politics
" In many cases, nomination for office is mediated through preselection processes in organized political parties.",politics
Non-partisan systems tend to be different from partisan systems as concerns nominations.,politics
" In a direct democracy, one type of non-partisan democracy, any eligible person can be nominated.",politics
" Although elections were used in ancient Athens, in Rome, and in the selection of popes and Holy Roman emperors, the origins of elections in the contemporary world lie in the gradual emergence of representative government in Europe and North America beginning in the 17th century.",politics
" In some systems no nominations take place at all, with voters free to choose any person at the time of voting—with some possible exceptions such as through a minimum age requirement—in the jurisdiction.",politics
" In such cases, it is not required (or even possible) that the members of the electorate be familiar with all of the eligible persons, though such systems may involve indirect elections at larger geographic levels to ensure that some first-hand familiarity among potential electees can exist at these levels (i.",politics

Electoral systems are the detailed constitutional arrangements and voting systems that convert the vote into a political decision.,politics
" The first step is to tally the votes, for which various vote counting systems and ballot types are used.",politics
 Voting systems then determine the result on the basis of the tally.,politics
 Most systems can be categorized as either proportional or majoritarian.,politics
  Among the former are party-list proportional representation and additional member system.,politics
  Among the latter are First Past the Post electoral system (relative majority) and absolute majority.,politics
"  Many countries have growing electoral reform movements, which advocate systems such as approval voting, single transferable vote, instant runoff voting or a Condorcet method; these methods are also gaining popularity for lesser elections in some countries where more important elections still use more traditional counting methods.",politics
"While openness and accountability are usually considered cornerstones of a democratic system, the act of casting a vote and the content of a voter's ballot are usually an important exception.",politics
"  The secret ballot is a relatively modern development, but it is now considered crucial in most free and fair elections, as it limits the effectiveness of intimidation.",politics
"When elections are called, politicians and their supporters attempt to influence policy by competing directly for the votes of constituents in what are called campaigns.",politics
"  Supporters for a campaign can be either formally organized or loosely affiliated, and frequently utilize campaign advertising.",politics
 It is common for political scientists to attempt to predict elections via Political Forecasting methods.,politics
The most expensive election campaign included US$7 billion spent on the 2012 United States presidential election and is followed by the US$5 billion spent on the 2014 Indian general election.,politics
"The nature of democracy is that elected officials are accountable to the people, and they must return to the voters at prescribed intervals to seek their mandate to continue in office.",politics
 For that reason most democratic constitutions provide that elections are held at fixed regular intervals.,politics
" In the United States, elections for public offices are typically held between every two and six years in most states and at the federal level, with exceptions for elected judicial positions that may have longer terms of office.",politics
" There is a variety of schedules, for example presidents: the President of Ireland is elected every seven years, the President of Russia and the President of Finland every six years, the President of France every five years, President of the United States every four years.",politics
Pre-decided or fixed election dates have the advantage of fairness and predictability.,politics
" However, they tend to greatly lengthen campaigns, and make dissolving the legislature (parliamentary system) more problematic if the date should happen to fall at time when dissolution is inconvenient (e.",politics
", the United Kingdom) only set maximum time in office, and the executive decides exactly when within that limit it will actually go to the polls.",politics
" In practice, this means the government remains in power for close to its full term, and choose an election date it calculates to be in its best interests (unless something special happens, such as a motion of no-confidence).",politics
" This calculation depends on a number of variables, such as its performance in opinion polls and the size of its majority.",politics
"In many of the countries with weak rule of law, the most common reason why elections do not meet international standards of being ""free and fair"" is interference from the incumbent government.",politics
" Dictators may use the powers of the executive (police, martial law, censorship, physical implementation of the election mechanism, etc.",politics
) to remain in power despite popular opinion in favor of removal.,politics
" Members of a particular faction in a legislature may use the power of the majority or supermajority (passing criminal laws, defining the electoral mechanisms including eligibility and district boundaries) to prevent the balance of power in the body from shifting to a rival faction due to an election.",politics
"Non-governmental entities can also interfere with elections, through physical force, verbal intimidation, or fraud, which can result in improper casting or counting of votes.",politics
 Monitoring for and minimizing electoral fraud is also an ongoing task in countries with strong traditions of free and fair elections.,politics
" Problems that prevent an election from being ""free and fair"" take various forms.",politics
"=== Lack of open political debate or an informed electorate ===
",politics
"The electorate may be poorly informed about issues or candidates due to lack of freedom of the press, lack of objectivity in the press due to state or corporate control, and/or lack of access to news and political media.",politics
" Freedom of speech may be curtailed by the state, favoring certain viewpoints or state propaganda.",politics
"Gerrymandering, exclusion of opposition candidates from eligibility for office, needlessly high restrictions on who may be a candidate, like ballot access rules, and manipulating thresholds for electoral success are some of the ways the structure of an election can be changed to favor a specific faction or candidate.",politics
"Those in power may arrest or assassinate candidates, suppress or even criminalize campaigning, close campaign headquarters, harass or beat campaign workers, or intimidate voters with violence.",politics
" Foreign electoral intervention can also occur, with the United States interfering between 1946 and 2000 in 81 elections and Russia/USSR in 36.",politics
"In 2018 the most intense interventions, by means of false information, were by China in Taiwan and by Russia in Latvia; the next highest levels were in Bahrain, Qatar and Hungary.",politics
"violation of the secret ballot, ballot stuffing, tampering with voting machines,
",politics
"destruction of legitimately cast ballots,voter suppression, voter registration fraud, failure to validate voter residency, fraudulent tabulation of results, and use of physical force or verbal intimation at polling places.",politics
" Other examples include persuading candidates not to run, such as through blackmailing, bribery, intimidation or physical violence.",politics
"A sham election, or show election, is an election that is held purely for show; that is, without any significant political choice or real impact on results of election.",politics
Sham elections are a common event in dictatorial regimes that feel the need to feign the appearance of public legitimacy.,politics
" Published results usually show nearly 100% voter turnout and high support (typically at least 80%, and close to 100% in many cases) for the prescribed candidate(s) or for the referendum choice that favors the political party in power.",politics
 Dictatorial regimes can also organize sham elections with results simulating those that might be achieved in democratic countries.,politics
"Sometimes, only one government approved candidate is allowed to run in sham elections with no opposition candidates allowed, or opposition candidates are arrested on false charges (or even without any charges) before the election to prevent them from running.",politics
"Ballots may contain only one ""yes"" option, or in the case of a simple ""yes or no"" question, security forces often persecute people who pick ""no"", thus encouraging them to pick the ""yes"" option.",politics
" In other cases, those who vote receive stamps in their passport for doing so, while those who did not vote (and thus do not receive stamps) are persecuted as enemies of the people.",politics
"In some cases, sham elections can backfire against the party in power, especially if the regime believes they are popular enough to win without coercion or fraud.",politics
" The most famous example of this was the 1990 Myanmar general election, in which the government-sponsored National Unity Party suffered a landslide defeat to the opposition National League for Democracy and consequently the results were annulled.",politics
"Examples of sham elections are the 1929 and 1934 elections in Fascist Italy, the 1942 general election in Imperial Japan, elections in Nazi Germany, the 1940 elections of the People's Parliaments in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the 1928, 1935, 1942, 1949, 1951 and 1958 elections in Portugal, the 1991 Kazakh presidential election, those in North Korea, and the 1995 and 2002 presidential referendums in Saddam Hussein's Iraq.",politics
"In Mexico, all of the presidential elections from 1929 to 1982 are considered to be sham elections, as the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and its predecessors governed the country in a de facto single-party system without serious opposition, and won all of the presidential elections in that period with percentages of votes well over 70%.",politics
" The first actually competitive presidential election in modern Mexican history was that of 1988, in which for the first time the PRI candidate faced two strong opposition candidates, though the opposition would not win until 2000.",politics
"A predetermined conclusion is always established by the regime through suppression of the opposition, coercion of voters, vote rigging, reporting a number of votes received greater than the number of voters, outright lying, or some combination of these.",politics
" King of Liberia was reported to have won by 234,000 votes in the 1927 general election, a ""majority"" that was over fifteen times larger than the number of eligible voters.",politics

"In political science, it has long been a goal to create a typology or taxonomy of polities, as typologies of political systems are not obvious.",politics
 It is especially important in the political science fields of comparative politics and international relations.,politics
" Like all categories discerned within forms of government, the boundaries of government classifications are either fluid or ill-defined.",politics
"Superficially, all governments have an official or ideal form.",politics
" The United States is a constitutional republic, while the former Soviet Union was a socialist republic.",politics
" However self-identification is not objective, and as Kopstein and Lichbach argue, defining regimes can be tricky.",politics
" For example, Voltaire argued that ""the Holy Roman Empire is neither Holy, nor Roman, nor an Empire"".",politics
Identifying a form of government is also difficult because many political systems originate as socio-economic movements and are then carried into governments by parties naming themselves after those movements; all with competing political-ideologies.,politics
" Experience with those movements in power, and the strong ties they may have to particular forms of government, can cause them to be considered as forms of government in themselves.",politics
"Other complications include general non-consensus or deliberate ""distortion or bias"" of reasonable technical definitions to political ideologies and associated forms of governing, due to the nature of politics in the modern era.",politics

" As Ribuffo notes, ""what Americans now call conservatism much of the world calls liberalism or neoliberalism""; a ""conservative"" in Finland would be labeled a ""socialist"" in the United States.",politics

"The difference of Commonwealths consisteth in the difference of the sovereign, or the person representative of all and every one of the multitude.",politics

" For the representative must needs be one man, or more; and if more, then it is the assembly of all, or but of a part.",politics
" When the representative is one man, then is the Commonwealth a monarchy; when an assembly of all that will come together, then it is a democracy, or popular Commonwealth; when an assembly of a part only, then it is called an aristocracy.",politics
" Other kind of Commonwealth there can be none: for either one, or more, or all, must have the sovereign power (which I have shown to be indivisible) entire.",politics
"An autocracy is a system of government in which supreme power is concentrated in the hands of one person, whose decisions are subject to neither external legal restraints nor regularized mechanisms of popular control (except perhaps for the implicit threat of a coup d'état or mass insurrection).",politics
"Aristocracy (Greek ἀριστοκρατία aristokratía, from  ἄριστος aristos ""excellent"", and κράτος kratos ""power"") is a form of government that places power in the hands of a small, privileged ruling class.",politics

 In the United States the president has always been both Head of State and Head of Government and has always had the title of President.,politics
Presidents in this system are either directly elected by popular vote or indirectly elected by an electoral college or some other democratically elected body.,politics
"In the United States, the president is indirectly elected by the Electoral College made up of electors chosen by voters in the presidential election.",politics
" In most states of the United States, each elector is committed to voting for a specified candidate determined by the popular vote in each state, so that the people, in voting for each elector, are in effect voting for the candidate.",politics

"A second system is the semi-presidential system, also known as the French model.",politics
" In this system, as in the parliamentary system, there are both a president and a prime minister; but unlike the parliamentary system, the president may have significant day-to-day power.",politics
" For example, in France, when their party controls the majority of seats in the National Assembly, the president can operate closely with the parliament and prime minister, and work towards a common agenda.",politics
" When the National Assembly is controlled by their opponents, however, the president can find themselves marginalized with the opposition party prime minister exercising most of the power.",politics
" Though the prime minister remains an appointee of the president, the president must obey the rules of parliament, and select a leader from the house's majority holding party.",politics
" Thus, sometimes the president and prime minister can be allies, sometimes rivals; the latter situation is known in France as cohabitation.",politics

"Governors of ethnic republics in the Russian Federation used to have the title of President, occasionally alongside other, secondary titles such as Chairman of the Government (also used by Prime Minister of Russia).",politics

Policy is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes.,politics
" A policy is a statement of intent, and is implemented as a procedure or protocol.",politics
 Policies are generally adopted by a governance body within an organization.,politics

The State of California provides an example of benefit-seeking policy.,politics
" In recent years, the numbers of hybrid cars in California has increased dramatically, in part because of policy changes in Federal law that provided USD $1,500 in tax credits (since phased out) as well as the use of high-occupancy vehicle lanes to hybrid owners (no loew hybrid vehicles).",politics
" In this case, the organization (state and/or federal government) created an effect (increased ownership and use of hybrid vehicles) through policy (tax breaks, highway lanes).",politics
Policies frequently have side effects or unintended consequences.,politics
  Because the environments that policies seek to influence or manipulate are typically complex adaptive systems (e.,politics
" governments, societies, large companies), making a policy change can have counterintuitive results.",politics
"  For example, a government may make a policy decision to raise taxes, in hopes of increasing overall tax revenue.",politics
"  Depending on the size of the tax increase, this may have the overall effect of reducing tax revenue by causing capital flight or by creating a rate so high that citizens are deterred from earning the money that is taxed.",politics
")The policy formulation process theoretically includes an attempt to assess as many areas of potential policy impact as possible, to lessen the chances that a given policy will have unexpected or unintended consequences.",politics
"In political science, the policy cycle is a tool used for analyzing the development of a policy item.",politics
" It can also be referred to as a ""stagist approach"", ""stages heuristic"" or ""stages approach"".",politics
" It is thus a rule of thumb rather than the actual reality of how policy is created, but has been influential in how political scientists looked at policy in general.",politics
"Harold Lasswell's popular model of the policy cycle divided the process into seven distinct stages, asking questions of both how and why public policies should be made.",politics
"  With the stages ranging from (1) intelligence, (2) promotion, (3) prescription, (4) invocation, (5) application, (6) termination and (7) appraisal, this process inherently attempts to combine policy implementation to formulated policy goals.",politics
" Anderson, in his Public Policy-Making (1974) has the following stages:
",politics
Agenda setting (Problem identification) – The recognition of certain subject as a problem demanding further government attention.,politics
Policy formulation – Involves exploring a variation of options or alternative courses of action available for addressing the problem.,politics
"Decision-making – Government decides on an ultimate course of action, whether to perpetuate the policy status quo or alter it.",politics
" (Decision could be 'positive', 'negative', or 'no-action')
",politics
Implementation – The ultimate decision made earlier will be put into practice.,politics
Evaluation – Assesses the effectiveness of a public policy in terms of its perceived intentions and results.,politics
 Policy actors attempt to determine whether the course of action is a success or failure by examining its impact and outcomes.,politics
"An eight step policy cycle is developed in detail in The Australian Policy Handbook by Peter Bridgman and Glyn Davis: (now with Catherine Althaus in its 4th and 5th editions)

"Policy EvaluationThe Althaus, Bridgman & Davis model is heuristic and iterative.",politics
 It is intentionally normative and not meant to be diagnostic or predictive.,politics
" Policy cycles are typically characterized as adopting a classical approach, and tend to describe processes from the perspective of policy decision makers.",politics
" Accordingly, some postpositivist academics challenge cyclical models as unresponsive and unrealistic, preferring systemic and more complex models.",politics
" They consider a broader range of actors involved in the policy space that includes civil society organisations, the media, intellectuals, think tanks or policy research institutes, corporations, lobbyists, etc.",politics
Policies are typically promulgated through official written documents.,politics
 Policy documents often come with the endorsement or signature of the executive powers within an organization to legitimize the policy and demonstrate that it is considered in force.,politics
 Such documents often have standard formats that are particular to the organization issuing the policy.,politics
"  While such formats differ in form, policy documents usually contain certain standard components including:
",politics
"A purpose statement, outlining why the organization is issuing the policy, and what its desired effect or outcome of the policy should be.",politics
"An applicability and scope statement, describing who the policy affects and which actions are impacted by the policy.",politics
" The applicability and scope may expressly exclude certain people, organizations, or actions from the policy requirements.",politics
"  Applicability and scope is used to focus the policy on only the desired targets, and avoid unintended consequences where possible.",politics
An effective date which indicates when the policy comes into force.,politics
"A responsibilities section, indicating which parties and organizations are responsible for carrying out individual policy statements.",politics
  Many policies may require the establishment of some ongoing function or action.,politics
"  For example, a purchasing policy might specify that a purchasing office be created to process purchase requests, and that this office would be responsible for ongoing actions.",politics
  Responsibilities often include identification of any relevant oversight and/or governance structures.,politics
"Policy statements indicating the specific regulations, requirements, or modifications to organizational behavior that the policy is creating.",politics
"  Policy statements are extremely diverse depending on the organization and intent, and may take almost any form.",politics
"Background, indicating any reasons, history, ethical background statements, and/or intent that led to the creation of the policy, which may be listed as motivating factors.",politics
"  This information is often quite valuable when policies must be evaluated or used in ambiguous situations, just as the intent of a law can be useful to a court when deciding a case that involves that law.",politics
"Definitions, providing clear and unambiguous definitions for terms and concepts found in the policy document.",politics
" Lowi proposed four types of policy, namely distributive, redistributive, regulatory and constituent in his article ""Four Systems of Policy, Politics and Choice"" and in ""American Business, Public Policy, Case Studies and Political Theory"".",politics
" Policy addresses the intent of the organization, whether government, business, professional, or voluntary.",politics
" Policy is intended to affect the ""real"" world, by guiding the decisions that are made.",politics
" Whether they are formally written or not, most organizations have identified policies.",politics
 The following is a sample of several different types of policies broken down by their effect on members of the organization.,politics
"Distributive policies extend goods and services to members of an organization, as well as distributing the costs of the goods/services amongst the members of the organization.",politics
" Examples include government policies that impact spending for welfare, public education, highways, and public safety, or a professional organization's benefits plan.",politics
"Regulatory policies, or mandates, limit the discretion of individuals and agencies, or otherwise compel certain types of behavior.",politics
 These policies are generally thought to be best applied when good behavior can be easily defined and bad behavior can be easily regulated and punished through fines or sanctions.,politics
 An example of a fairly successful public regulatory policy is that of a highway speed limit.,politics
"Constituent policies create executive power entities, or deal with laws.",politics
 Constituent policies also deal with fiscal policy in some circumstances.,politics
Policies are dynamic; they are not just static lists of goals or laws.,politics
" Policy blueprints have to be implemented, often with unexpected results.",politics
" Social policies are what happens 'on the ground' when they are implemented, as well as what happens at the decision making or legislative stage.",politics
"Official government policy (legislation or guidelines that govern how laws should be put into operation)
",politics
"Broad ideas and goals in political manifestos and pamphlets
",politics
"  For example, the equal opportunity policy of a company shows that the company aims to treat all its staff equally.",politics
The actions the organization actually takes may often vary significantly from stated policy.,politics
" This difference is sometimes caused by political compromise over policy, while in other situations it is caused by lack of policy implementation and enforcement.",politics

"A republic (Latin: res publica, meaning ""public affair"") is a form of government in which ""power is held by the people and their elected representatives"".",politics
" In republics, the country is considered a ""public matter"", not the private concern or property of the rulers.",politics
 The primary positions of power within a republic are attained through democracy or a mix of democracy with oligarchy or autocracy rather than being unalterably occupied by any given family lineage or group.,politics
" With modern republicanism, it has become the opposing form of government to a monarchy and therefore a modern republic has no monarch as head of state.",politics
"As of 2017, 159 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word ""republic"" as part of their official names – not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor is the word ""republic"" used in the names of all states with elected governments.",politics
"The word republic comes from the Latin term res publica, which literally means ""public thing"", ""public matter"", or ""public affair"" and was used to refer to the state as a whole.",politics
" The term developed its modern meaning in reference to the constitution of the ancient Roman Republic, lasting from the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC to the establishment of the Empire in 27 BC.",politics
" This constitution was characterized by a Senate composed of wealthy aristocrats wielding significant influence; several popular assemblies of all free citizens, possessing the power to elect magistrates and pass laws; and a series of magistracies with varying types of civil and political authority.",politics
"Most often a republic is a single sovereign state, but there are also sub-sovereign state entities that are referred to as republics, or that have governments that are described as republican in nature.",politics
" For instance, Article IV of the United States Constitution ""guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government"".",politics
" Another example is the Soviet Union which described itself as being a federation of ""Soviet Socialist Republics"", in reference to the 15 individually federal, multinational, top-level subdivisions or republics.",politics
 The Russian Federation is a state that is composed partly of several republics.,politics
The term originates from the Latin translation of Greek word politeia.,politics
" Cicero, among other Latin writers, translated politeia as res publica and it was in turn translated by Renaissance scholars as ""republic"" (or similar terms in various western European languages).",politics
"The term politeia can be translated as form of government, polity, or regime and is therefore not always a word for a specific type of regime as the modern word republic is.",politics
 One of Plato's major works on political science was titled Politeia and in English it is thus known as The Republic.,politics
" However, apart from the title, in modern translations of The Republic, alternative translations of politeia are also used.",politics
"However, in Book III of his Politics, Aristotle was apparently the first classical writer to state that the term politeia can be used to refer more specifically to one type of politeia: ""When the citizens at large govern for the public good, it is called by the name common to all governments (to koinon onoma pasōn tōn politeiōn), government (politeia)"".",politics
" Also amongst classical Latin, the term ""republic"" can be used in a general way to refer to any regime, or in a specific way to refer to governments which work for the public good.",politics
"In medieval Northern Italy, a number of city states had commune or signoria based governments.",politics
" In the late Middle Ages, writers such as Giovanni Villani began writing about the nature of these states and the differences from other types of regime.",politics
" They used terms such as libertas populi, a free people, to describe the states.",politics
 The terminology changed in the 15th century as the renewed interest in the writings of Ancient Rome caused writers to prefer using classical terminology.,politics
" To describe non-monarchical states writers, most importantly Leonardo Bruni, adopted the Latin phrase res publica.",politics
"While Bruni and Machiavelli used the term to describe the states of Northern Italy, which were not monarchies, the term res publica has a set of interrelated meanings in the original Latin.",politics
" The term can quite literally be translated as ""public matter"".",politics
" It was most often used by Roman writers to refer to the state and government, even during the period of the Roman Empire.",politics
"In subsequent centuries, the English word ""commonwealth"" came to be used as a translation of res publica, and its use in English was comparable to how the Romans used the term res publica.",politics
" Notably, during The Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell the word commonwealth was the most common term to call the new monarchless state, but the word republic was also in common use.",politics
" Likewise, in Polish the term was translated as rzeczpospolita, although the translation is now only used with respect to Poland.",politics
"Presently, the term ""republic"" commonly means a system of government which derives its power from the people rather than from another basis, such as heredity or divine right.",politics
"While the philosophical terminology developed in classical Greece and Rome, as already noted by Aristotle there was already a long history of city states with a wide variety of constitutions, not only in Greece but also in the Middle East.",politics
" After the classical period, during the Middle Ages, many free cities developed again, such as Venice.",politics
"The modern type of ""republic"" itself is different from any type of state found in the classical world.",politics
" Nevertheless, there are a number of states of the classical era that are today still called republics.",politics
" While the structure and governance of these states was different from that of any modern republic, there is debate about the extent to which classical, medieval, and modern republics form a historical continuum.",politics
 Pocock has argued that a distinct republican tradition stretches from the classical world to the present.,politics
" Paul Rahe, for instance, argues that the classical republics had a form of government with few links to those in any modern country.",politics
The political philosophy of the classical republics has in any case had an influence on republican thought throughout the subsequent centuries.,politics
" Philosophers and politicians advocating republics, such as Machiavelli, Montesquieu, Adams, and Madison, relied heavily on classical Greek and Roman sources which described various types of regimes.",politics
" One form Aristotle named politeia, which consisted of a mixture of the other forms.",politics
 He argued that this was one of the ideal forms of government.,politics
" Polybius expanded on many of these ideas, again focusing on the idea of mixed government.",politics
 The most important Roman work in this tradition is Cicero's De re publica.,politics
"Over time, the classical republics were either conquered by empires or became ones themselves.",politics
 Most of the Greek republics were annexed to the Macedonian Empire of Alexander.,politics
" The Roman Republic expanded dramatically conquering the other states of the Mediterranean that could be considered republics, such as Carthage.",politics
"The term ""republic"" is not commonly used to refer to pre-classical city-states, especially if outside Europe and the area which was under Graeco-Roman influence.",politics
 However some early states outside Europe had governments that are sometimes today considered similar to republics.,politics
"In the ancient Near East, a number of cities of the Eastern Mediterranean achieved collective rule.",politics
 Republic city-states flourished in Phoenicia along the Levantine coast starting from the 11th century BC.,politics
" In ancient Phoenicia, the concept of Shophet, very similar to a Roman consul, came to be; both served for a year in pair of two.",politics
" Under Persian rule (539–332 BCE), Phoenician city-states such as Tyre abolished the king system and adopted ""a system of the suffetes (judges), who remained in power for short mandates of 6 years"".",politics
" Arwad has been cited as one of the earliest known examples of a republic, in which the people, rather than a monarch, are described as sovereign.",politics
before the United Monarchy has also been considered a type of republic.,politics
 In Africa the Axum Empire was organized as a confederation ruled similarly to a royal republic.,politics
"Early republican institutions comes from the independent Gaṇa sanghas - gana means ""tribe"" and sangha means ""assembly"" - which may have existed as early as the 6th century BC and persisted in some areas until the 4th century in India.",politics
" The evidence for this is scattered, however, and no pure historical source exists for that period.",politics
" Diodorus, a Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of Alexander the Great's invasion of India (now Pakistan and northwest India) mentions, without offering any detail, that independent and democratic states existed in India.",politics
" Modern scholars note the word democracy at the time of the 3rd century BC and later suffered from degradation and could mean any autonomous state, no matter how oligarchic in nature.",politics
"Key characteristics of the gana seem to include a monarch, usually known by the name raja, and a deliberative assembly.",politics
" At least in some states, attendance was open to all free men.",politics
" This body also had full financial, administrative, and judicial authority.",politics
" Other officers, who rarely receive any mention, obeyed the decisions of the assembly.",politics
" Elected by the gana, the monarch apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of Kshatriya Varna.",politics
" The monarch coordinated his activities with the assembly; in some states, he did so with a council of other nobles.",politics
" The Licchavis had a primary governing body of 7,077 rajas, the heads of the most important families.",politics
" On the other hand, the Shakyas, Koliyas, Mallas, and Licchavis, during the period around Gautama Buddha, had the assembly open to all men, rich and poor.",politics
" Early ""republics"" or gaṇa sangha, such as Mallas, centered in the city of Kusinagara, and the Vajji (or Vriji) confederation, centered in the city of Vaishali, existed as early as the 6th century BC and persisted in some areas until the 4th century AD.",politics
 The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate clans of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the Licchavis.,politics
 The Magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara.,politics
 Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas.,politics
" Their administrations were divided into executive, judicial, and military functions.",politics
"Scholars differ over how best to describe these governments, and the vague, sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements.",politics
 Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies; other scholars focus on the upper-class domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an oligarchy or an aristocracy.,politics
" Despite the assembly's obvious power, it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation were truly popular.",politics
" This is reflected in the Arthashastra, an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently.",politics
" It contains a chapter on how to deal with the sanghas, which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders, yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizens, indicating that the ""Gaṇa sanghas"" are more of an aristocratic rule, or oligarchic republic, than ""democracy"".",politics
The Icelandic Commonwealth was established in AD 930 by refugees from Norway who had fled the unification of that country under King Harald Fairhair.,politics
" The Commonwealth consisted of a number of clans run by chieftains, and the Althing was a combination of parliament and supreme court where disputes appealed from lower courts were settled, laws were decided, and decisions of national importance were taken.",politics
" One such example was the Christianisation of Iceland in 1000, where the Althing decreed, in order to prevent an invasion, that all Icelanders must be baptized, and forbade celebration of pagan rituals.",politics
" Contrary to most states, the Icelandic Commonwealth had no official leader.",politics
"In the early 13th century, the Age of the Sturlungs, the Commonwealth began to suffer from long conflicts between warring clans.",politics
" This, combined with pressure from the Norwegian king Haakon IV for the Icelanders to rejoin the Norwegian ""family"", led the Icelandic chieftains to accept Haakon IV as king by the signing of the Gamli sáttmáli (""Old Covenant"") in 1262.",politics
" The Althing, however, is still Iceland's parliament, almost 800 years later.",politics
In Europe new republics appeared in the late Middle Ages when a number of small states embraced republican systems of government.,politics
" These were generally small, but wealthy, trading states, like the Italian city-states and the Hanseatic League, in which the merchant class had risen to prominence.",politics
" Knud Haakonssen has noted that, by the Renaissance, Europe was divided with those states controlled by a landed elite being monarchies and those controlled by a commercial elite being republics.",politics
"Italy was the most densely populated area of Europe, and also one with the weakest central government.",politics
 Many of the towns thus gained considerable independence and adopted commune forms of government.,politics
" Completely free of feudal control, the Italian city-states expanded, gaining control of the rural hinterland.",politics
 The two most powerful were the Republic of Venice and its rival the Republic of Genoa.,politics
" Each were large trading ports, and further expanded by using naval power to control large parts of the Mediterranean.",politics
 It was in Italy that an ideology advocating for republics first developed.,politics
" Writers such as Bartholomew of Lucca, Brunetto Latini, Marsilius of Padua, and Leonardo Bruni saw the medieval city-states as heirs to the legacy of Greece and Rome.",politics
Across Europe a wealthy merchant class developed in the important trading cities.,politics
" Despite their wealth they had little power in the feudal system dominated by the rural land owners, and across Europe began to advocate for their own privileges and powers.",politics
" The more centralized states, such as France and England, granted limited city charters.",politics
"In the more loosely governed Holy Roman Empire, 51 of the largest towns became free imperial cities.",politics
 While still under the dominion of the Holy Roman Emperor most power was held locally and many adopted republican forms of government.,politics
 The same rights to imperial immediacy were secured by the major trading cities of Switzerland.,politics
" The towns and villages of alpine Switzerland had, courtesy of geography, also been largely excluded from central control.",politics
" Unlike Italy and Germany, much of the rural area was thus not controlled by feudal barons, but by independent farmers who also used communal forms of government.",politics
 When the Habsburgs tried to reassert control over the region both rural farmers and town merchants joined the rebellion.,politics
" The Swiss were victorious, and the Swiss Confederacy was proclaimed, and Switzerland has retained a republican form of government to the present.",politics
"Two Russian cities with a powerful merchant class—Novgorod and Pskov—also adopted republican forms of government in 12th and 13th centuries, respectively, which ended when the republics were conquered by Muscovy/Russia at the end of 15th – beginning of 16th century.",politics
The dominant form of government for these early republics was control by a limited council of elite patricians.,politics
" In those areas that held elections, property qualifications or guild membership limited both who could vote and who could run.",politics
 In many states no direct elections were held and council members were hereditary or appointed by the existing council.,politics
" This left the great majority of the population without political power, and riots and revolts by the lower classes were common.",politics
 The late Middle Ages saw more than 200 such risings in the towns of the Holy Roman Empire.,politics
" Similar revolts occurred in Italy, notably the Ciompi Revolt in Florence.",politics
"Following the collapse of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum and establishment of the Turkish Anatolian Beyliks, the Ahiler merchant fraternities established a state centered on Ankara that is sometimes compared to the Italian mercantile republics.",politics
"While the classical writers had been the primary ideological source for the republics of Italy, in Northern Europe, the Protestant Reformation would be used as justification for establishing new republics.",politics
" Most important was Calvinist theology, which developed in the Swiss Confederacy, one of the largest and most powerful of the medieval republics.",politics
" John Calvin did not call for the abolition of monarchy, but he advanced the doctrine that the faithful had the duty to overthrow irreligious monarchs.",politics
 Advocacy for republics appeared in the writings of the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion.,politics
Calvinism played an important role in the republican revolts in England and the Netherlands.,politics
" Like the city-states of Italy and the Hanseatic League, both were important trading centres, with a large merchant class prospering from the trade with the New World.",politics
 Large parts of the population of both areas also embraced Calvinism.,politics
" During the Dutch Revolt (beginning in 1566), the Dutch Republic emerged from rejection of Spanish Habsburg rule.",politics
" However, the country did not adopt the republican form of government immediately: in the formal declaration of independence (Act of Abjuration, 1581), the throne of king Philip was only declared vacant, and the Dutch magistrates asked the Duke of Anjou, queen Elizabeth of England and prince William of Orange, one after another, to replace Philip.",politics
" It took until 1588 before the Estates (the Staten, the representative assembly at the time) decided to vest the sovereignty of the country in themselves.",politics
" Spearheaded by the Puritans and funded by the merchants of London, the revolt was a success, and King Charles I was executed.",politics
" In England James Harrington, Algernon Sidney, and John Milton became some of the first writers to argue for rejecting monarchy and embracing a republican form of government.",politics
" The English Commonwealth was short lived, and the monarchy was soon restored.",politics
" The Dutch Republic continued in name until 1795, but by the mid-18th century the stadtholder had become a de facto monarch.",politics
 Calvinists were also some of the earliest settlers of the British and Dutch colonies of North America.,politics
"Along with these initial republican revolts, early modern Europe also saw a great increase in monarchical power.",politics
 The era of absolute monarchy replaced the limited and decentralized monarchies that had existed in most of the Middle Ages.,politics
 It also saw a reaction against the total control of the monarch as a series of writers created the ideology known as liberalism.,politics
Most of these Enlightenment thinkers were far more interested in ideas of constitutional monarchy than in republics.,politics
" The Cromwell regime had discredited republicanism, and most thinkers felt that republics ended in either anarchy or tyranny.",politics
 Thus philosophers like Voltaire opposed absolutism while at the same time being strongly pro-monarchy.,politics
"Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu praised republics, and looked on the city-states of Greece as a model.",politics
" However, both also felt that a state like France, with 20 million people, would be impossible to govern as a republic.",politics
" Rousseau admired the republican experiment in Corsica (1755–1769) and described his ideal political structure of small, self-governing communes.",politics
" Montesquieu felt that a city-state should ideally be a republic, but maintained that a limited monarchy was better suited to a state with a larger territory.",politics
"The American Revolution began as a rejection only of the authority of the British Parliament over the colonies, not of the monarchy.",politics
" The failure of the British monarch to protect the colonies from what they considered the infringement of their rights to representative government, the monarch's branding of those requesting redress as traitors, and his support for sending combat troops to demonstrate authority resulted in widespread perception of the British monarchy as tyrannical.",politics
With the United States Declaration of Independence the leaders of the revolt firmly rejected the monarchy and embraced republicanism.,politics
" The leaders of the revolution were well versed in the writings of the French liberal thinkers, and also in history of the classical republics.",politics
 John Adams had notably written a book on republics throughout history.,politics
" In addition, the widely distributed and popularly read-aloud tract Common Sense, by Thomas Paine,  succinctly and eloquently laid out the case for republican ideals and independence to the larger public.",politics
" The Constitution of the United States, ratified in 1789, created a relatively strong federal republic to replace the relatively weak confederation under the first attempt at a national government with the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union ratified in 1781.",politics
" The first ten amendments to the Constitution, called the United States Bill of Rights, guaranteed certain natural rights fundamental to republican ideals that justified the Revolution.",politics
The French Revolution was also not republican at its outset.,politics
 Only after the Flight to Varennes removed most of the remaining sympathy for the king was a republic declared and Louis XVI sent to the guillotine.,politics
 The stunning success of France in the French Revolutionary Wars saw republics spread by force of arms across much of Europe as a series of client republics were set up across the continent.,politics
" The rise of Napoleon saw the end of the French First Republic and her Sister Republics, each replaced by ""popular monarchies"".",politics
" Throughout the Napoleonic period, the victors extinguished many of the oldest republics on the continent, including the Republic of Venice, the Republic of Genoa, and the Dutch Republic.",politics
 They were eventually transformed into monarchies or absorbed into neighbouring monarchies.,politics
Outside Europe another group of republics was created as the Napoleonic Wars allowed the states of Latin America to gain their independence.,politics
 Liberal ideology had only a limited impact on these new republics.,politics
 The main impetus was the local European descended Creole population in conflict with the Peninsulares—governors sent from overseas.,politics
" The majority of the population in most of Latin America was of either African or Amerindian descent, and the Creole elite had little interest in giving these groups power and broad-based popular sovereignty.",politics
" Simón Bolívar, both the main instigator of the revolts and one of its most important theorists, was sympathetic to liberal ideals but felt that Latin America lacked the social cohesion for such a system to function and advocated autocracy as necessary.",politics
In Mexico this autocracy briefly took the form of a monarchy in the First Mexican Empire.,politics
" Due to the Peninsular War, the Portuguese court was relocated to Brazil in 1808.",politics
" Brazil gained independence as a monarchy on September 7, 1822, and the Empire of Brazil lasted until 1889.",politics
 In the other states various forms of autocratic republic existed until most were liberalized at the end of the 20th century.,politics
"The French Second Republic was created in 1848, but abolished by Napoleon III who proclaimed himself Emperor in 1852.",politics
" The French Third Republic was established in 1870, when a civil revolutionary committee refused to accept Napoleon III's surrender during the Franco-Prussian War.",politics
" Spain briefly became the First Spanish Republic in 1873–74, but the monarchy was soon restored.",politics
" By the start of the 20th century France, Switzerland and San Marino remained the only republics in Europe.",politics
" This changed when, after the 1908 Lisbon Regicide, the 5 October 1910 revolution established the Portuguese Republic.",politics
"In East Asia, China had seen considerable anti-Qing sentiment during the 19th century, and a number of protest movements developed calling for constitutional monarchy.",politics
" The most important leader of these efforts was Sun Yat-sen, whose Three Principles of the People combined American, European, and Chinese ideas.",politics
" Under his leadership the Republic of China was proclaimed on January 1, 1912.",politics
"Republicanism expanded significantly in the aftermath of World War I, when several of the largest European empires collapsed: the Russian Empire (1917), German Empire (1918), Austro-Hungarian Empire (1918), and Ottoman Empire (1922) were all replaced by republics.",politics
" New states gained independence during this turmoil, and many of these, such as Ireland, Poland, Finland and Czechoslovakia, chose republican forms of government.",politics
" Following Greece's defeat in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–22), the monarchy was briefly replaced by the Second Hellenic Republic (1924–35).",politics
" In 1931, the proclamation of the Second Spanish Republic (1931–39) resulted in the Spanish Civil War that would be the prelude of World War II.",politics
" The United States began to have considerable influence in East Asia in the later part of the 19th century, with Protestant missionaries playing a central role.",politics
 The liberal and republican writers of the west also exerted influence.,politics
 These combined with native Confucian inspired political philosophy that had long argued that the populace had the right to reject unjust government that had lost the Mandate of Heaven.,politics
"Two short-lived republics were proclaimed in East Asia, the Republic of Formosa and the First Philippine Republic.",politics
"In the years following World War II, most of the remaining European colonies gained their independence, and most became republics.",politics
 The two largest colonial powers were France and the United Kingdom.,politics
 Republican France encouraged the establishment of republics in its former colonies.,politics
 The United Kingdom attempted to follow the model it had for its earlier settler colonies of creating independent Commonwealth realms still linked under the same monarchy.,politics
" While most of the settler colonies and the smaller states of the Caribbean retained this system, it was rejected by the newly independent countries in Africa and Asia, which revised their constitutions and became republics.",politics
"Britain followed a different model in the Middle East; it installed local monarchies in several colonies and mandates including Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Yemen and Libya.",politics
 In subsequent decades revolutions and coups overthrew a number of monarchs and installed republics.,politics
" Several monarchies remain, and the Middle East is the only part of the world where several large states are ruled by monarchs with almost complete political control.",politics
"In the wake of the First World War, the Russian monarchy fell during the Russian Revolution.",politics
" The Russian Provisional Government was established in its place on the lines of a liberal republic, but this was overthrown by the Bolsheviks who went on to establish the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.",politics
 This was the first republic established under Marxist-Leninist ideology.,politics
" Communism was wholly opposed to monarchy, and became an important element of many republican movements during the 20th century.",politics
" The Russian Revolution spread into Mongolia, and overthrew its theocratic monarchy in 1924.",politics
" In the aftermath of the Second World War the communists gradually gained control of Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary and Albania, ensuring that the states were reestablished as socialist republics rather than monarchies.",politics
 It was embraced by many national liberation movements during decolonization.,politics
" In Vietnam, communist republicans pushed aside the Nguyễn Dynasty, and monarchies in neighbouring Laos and Cambodia were overthrown by communist movements in the 1970s.",politics
" Arab socialism contributed to a series of revolts and coups that saw the monarchies of Egypt, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen ousted.",politics
 In Africa Marxist-Leninism and African socialism led to the end of monarchy and the proclamation of republics in states such as Burundi and Ethiopia.,politics
"Islamic political philosophy has a long history of opposition to absolute monarchy, notably in the work of Al-Farabi.",politics
" Sharia law took precedence over the will of the ruler, and electing rulers by means of the Shura was an important doctrine.",politics
" While the early caliphate maintained the principles of an elected ruler, later states became hereditary or military dictatorships though many maintained some pretense of a consultative shura.",politics
None of these states are typically referred to as republics.,politics
" The current usage of republic in Muslim countries is borrowed from the western meaning, adopted into the language in the late 19th century.",politics
" The 20th century saw republicanism become an important idea in much of the Middle East, as monarchies were removed in many states of the region.",politics
" Some nations, such as Indonesia and Azerbaijan, began as secular.",politics
" In Iran, the 1979 revolution overthrew the monarchy and created an Islamic republic based on the ideas of Islamic democracy.",politics
"With no monarch, most modern republics use the title president for the head of state.",politics
" Originally used to refer to the presiding officer of a committee or governing body in Great Britain the usage was also applied to political leaders, including the leaders of some of the Thirteen Colonies (originally Virginia in 1608); in full, the ""President of the Council"".",politics
 The first republic to adopt the title was the United States of America.,politics
 Keeping its usage as the head of a committee the President of the Continental Congress was the leader of the original congress.,politics
 When the new constitution was written the title of President of the United States was conferred on the head of the new executive branch.,politics
"If the head of state of a republic is also the head of government, this is called a presidential system.",politics
 A full-presidential system has a president with substantial authority and a central political role.,politics
"In other states the legislature is dominant and the presidential role is almost purely ceremonial and apolitical, such as in Germany, Italy, India, and Trinidad and Tobago.",politics
 These states are parliamentary republics and operate similarly to constitutional monarchies with parliamentary systems where the power of the monarch is also greatly circumscribed.,politics
" In parliamentary systems the head of government, most often titled prime minister, exercises the most real political power.",politics
" Semi-presidential systems have a president as an active head of state with important powers, but they also have a prime minister as a head of government with important powers.",politics
"The rules for appointing the president and the leader of the government, in some republics permit the appointment of a president and a prime minister who have opposing political convictions: in France, when the members of the ruling cabinet and the president come from opposing political factions, this situation is called cohabitation.",politics
"In some countries, like Bosnia and Herzegovina, San Marino, and Switzerland, the head of state is not a single person but a committee (council) of several persons holding that office.",politics
" The Roman Republic had two consuls, elected for a one-year term by the comitia centuriata, consisting of all adult, freeborn males who could prove citizenship.",politics
"In liberal democracies, presidents are elected, either directly by the people or indirectly by a parliament or council.",politics
" Typically in presidential and semi-presidential systems the president is directly elected by the people, or is indirectly elected as done in the United States.",politics
" In that country the president is officially elected by an electoral college, chosen by the States, all of which do so by direct election of the electors.",politics
 The indirect election of the president through the electoral college conforms to the concept of republic as one with a system of indirect election.,politics
" In the opinion of some, direct election confers legitimacy upon the president and gives the office much of its political power.",politics
" However, this concept of legitimacy differs from that expressed in the United States Constitution which established the legitimacy of the United States president as resulting from the signing of the Constitution by nine states.",politics
" The idea that direct election is required for legitimacy also contradicts the spirit of the Great Compromise, whose actual result was manifest in the clause that provides voters in smaller states with more representation in presidential selection than those in large states; for example citizens of Wyoming in 2016 had 3.",politics
6 times as much electoral vote representation as citizens of California.,politics
In states with a parliamentary system the president is usually elected by the parliament.,politics
" This indirect election subordinates the president to the parliament, and also gives the president limited legitimacy and turns most presidential powers into reserve powers that can only be exercised under rare circumstance.",politics
" There are exceptions where elected presidents have only ceremonial powers, such as in Ireland.",politics
The distinction between a republic and a monarchy is not always clear.,politics
" The constitutional monarchies of the former British Empire and Western Europe today have almost all real political power vested in the elected representatives, with the monarchs only holding either theoretical powers, no powers or rarely used reserve powers.",politics
 Real legitimacy for political decisions comes from the elected representatives and is derived from the will of the people.,politics
" While hereditary monarchies remain in place, political power is derived from the people as in a republic.",politics
 These states are thus sometimes referred to as crowned republics.,politics
"Terms such as ""liberal republic"" are also used to describe all of the modern liberal democracies.",politics
There are also self-proclaimed republics that act similarly to monarchies with absolute power vested in the leader and passed down from father to son.,politics
 North Korea and Syria are two notable examples where a son has inherited political control.,politics
" There is no constitutional requirement that power be passed down within one family, but it has occurred in practice.",politics
"There are also elective monarchies where ultimate power is vested in a monarch, but the monarch is chosen by some manner of election.",politics
" A current example of such a state is Malaysia where the Yang di-Pertuan Agong is elected every five years by the Conference of Rulers composed of the nine hereditary rulers of the Malay states, and the Vatican City-State, where the pope is selected by cardinal-electors, currently all cardinals under a specific age.",politics
" While rare today, elective monarchs were common in the past.",politics
" The Holy Roman Empire is an important example, where each new emperor was chosen by a group of electors.",politics
" Islamic states also rarely employed primogeniture, instead relying on various forms of election to choose a monarch's successor.",politics
"The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had an elective monarchy, with a wide suffrage of some 500,000 nobles.",politics
" The system, known as the Golden Liberty, had developed as a method for powerful landowners to control the crown.",politics
" The proponents of this system looked to classical examples, and the writings of the Italian Renaissance, and called their elective monarchy a rzeczpospolita, based on res publica.",politics
In general being a republic also implies sovereignty as for the state to be ruled by the people it cannot be controlled by a foreign power.,politics
" There are important exceptions to this, for example, republics in the Soviet Union were member states which had to meet three criteria to be named republics:
",politics
"be on the periphery of the Soviet Union so as to be able to take advantage of their theoretical right to secede;
",politics
"be economically strong enough to be self-sufficient upon secession; and
",politics

"It is sometimes argued that the former Soviet Union was also a supra-national republic, based on the claim that the member states were different nation states.",politics
"The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was a federal entity composed of six republics (Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Slovenia).",politics
" Each republic had its parliament, government, institute of citizenship, constitution, etc.",politics
", but certain functions were delegated to the federation (army, monetary matters).",politics
 Each republic also had a right of self-determination according to the conclusions of the second session of the AVNOJ and according to the federal constitution.,politics
"States of the United States are required, like the federal government, to be republican in form, with final authority resting with the people.",politics
" This was required because the states were intended to create and enforce most domestic laws, with the exception of areas delegated to the federal government and prohibited to the states.",politics
 The founding fathers of the country intended most domestic laws to be handled by the states.,politics
" Requiring the states to be a republic in form was seen as protecting the citizens' rights and preventing a state from becoming a dictatorship or monarchy, and reflected unwillingness on the part of the original 13 states (all independent republics) to unite with other states that were not republics.",politics
" Additionally, this requirement ensured that only other republics could join the union.",politics
"In the example of the United States, the original 13 British colonies became independent states after the American Revolution, each having a republican form of government.",politics
 These independent states initially formed a loose confederation called the United States and then later formed the current United States by ratifying the current U.,politics
 Any state joining the union later was also required to be a republic.,politics
"In Switzerland, all cantons can be considered to have a republican form of government.",politics
" Several Romance-speaking cantons are also officially referred to as republics, reflecting their history and will of independence within the Swiss Confederation.",politics
 Notable examples are the Republic and Canton of Geneva and the Republic and Canton of Ticino.,politics
The term republic originated from the writers of the Renaissance as a descriptive term for states that were not monarchies.,politics
" These writers, such as Machiavelli, also wrote important prescriptive works describing how such governments should function.",politics
 These ideas of how a government and society should be structured is the basis for an ideology known as classical republicanism or civic humanism.,politics
" This ideology is based on the Roman Republic and the city states of Ancient Greece and focuses on ideals such as civic virtue, rule of law and mixed government.",politics
This understanding of a republic as a distinct form of government from a liberal democracy is one of the main theses of the Cambridge School of historical analysis.,politics
 Pocock who in 1975 argued that a series of scholars had expressed a consistent set of republican ideals.,politics
" These writers included Machiavelli, Milton, Montesquieu and the founders of the United States of America.",politics
Pocock argued that this was an ideology with a history and principles distinct from liberalism.,politics
" These ideas were embraced by a number of different writers, including Quentin Skinner, Philip Pettit and Cass Sunstein.",politics
" These subsequent writers have further explored the history of the idea, and also outlined how a modern republic should function.",politics
"A distinct set of definitions of the term ""republic"" evolved in the United States, where the term is often equated with ""representative democracy.",politics
""" This narrower understanding of the term was originally developed by James Madison and notably employed in Federalist Paper No.",politics
" This meaning was widely adopted early in the history of the United States, including in Noah Webster's dictionary of 1828.",politics
 It was a novel meaning to the term; representative democracy was not an idea mentioned by Machiavelli and did not exist in the classical republics.,politics
" There is also evidence that contemporaries of Madison considered the meaning of ""republic"" to reflect the broader definition found elsewhere, as is the case with a quotation of Benjamin Franklin taken from the notes of James McHenry where the question is put forth, ""a Republic or a Monarchy?"".",politics
"The term republic does not appear in the Declaration of Independence, but it does appear in Article IV of the Constitution, which ""guarantee[s] to every State in this Union a Republican form of Government.",politics
""" What exactly the writers of the constitution felt this should mean is uncertain.",politics
" Borden (1849), declared that the definition of republic was a ""political question"" in which it would not intervene.",politics
" Cruikshank (1875), the court ruled that the ""equal rights of citizens"" were inherent to the idea of a republic.",politics
"However, the term republic is not synonymous with the republican form.",politics
" The republican form is defined as one in which the powers of sovereignty are vested in the people and are exercised by the people, either directly, or through representatives chosen by the people, to whom those powers are specially delegated.",politics
"Beyond these basic definitions, the word republic has a number of other connotations.",politics
" Paul Adams observes that republic is most often used in the United States as a synonym for ""state"" or ""government,"" but with more positive connotations than either of those terms.",politics
  Republicanism is often referred to as the founding ideology of the United States.,politics
 Traditionally scholars believed this American republicanism was a derivation of the classical liberal ideologies of John Locke and others developed in Europe.,politics
A political philosophy of republicanism that formed during the Renaissance period and initiated by Machiavelli was thought to have had little impact on the founders of the United States.,politics
" In the 1960s and 1970s, a revisionist school led by the likes of Bernard Bailyn began to argue that republicanism was just as or even more important than liberalism in the creation of the United States.",politics
 This issue is still much disputed and scholars like Isaac Kramnick completely reject this view.,politics

"Governance comprises all of the processes of governing – whether undertaken by the government of a state, by a market, or by a network – over a social system (family, tribe, formal or informal organization, a territory or across territories) and whether through the laws, norms, power or language of an organized society.",politics
" It relates to ""the processes of interaction and decision-making among the actors involved in a collective problem that lead to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of social norms and institutions"".",politics
"In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions.",politics
A variety of entities (known generically as governing bodies) can govern.,politics
" The most formal is a government, a body whose sole responsibility and authority is to make binding decisions in a given geopolitical system (such as a state) by establishing laws.",politics
" Other types of governing include an organization (such as a corporation recognized as a legal entity by a government), a socio-political group (chiefdom, tribe, gang, family, religious denomination, etc.",politics
" In business and outsourcing relationships, Governance Frameworks are built into relational contracts that foster long-term collaboration and innovation.",politics
"Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained
",politics
" The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given organization and, externally, with its business partners.",politics
" As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results.",politics
" For instance, a government may operate as a democracy where citizens vote on who should govern and the public good is the goal, while a non-profit organization or a corporation may be governed by a small board of directors and pursue more specific aims.",politics
"In addition, a variety of external actors without decision-making power can influence the process of governing.",politics
" These include lobbies, think tanks, political parties, non-government organizations, community and media.",politics
"Most institutions of higher education offer governance as an area of study, such as the Balsillie School of International Affairs, Munk School of Global Affairs, Sciences Po Paris, Graduate Institute Geneva, Hertie School, and London School of Economics, among others.",politics
"Like government, the word governance derives, ultimately, from the Greek verb kubernaein [kubernáo] (meaning to steer, the metaphorical sense first being attested in Plato).",politics
" Its occasional use in English to refer to the specific activity of ruling a country can be traced to early-modern England, when the phrase ""governance of the realm"" appears in works by William Tyndale and in royal correspondence from James V of Scotland to Henry VIII of England.",politics
" The first usage in connection with institutional structures (as distinct from individual rule) appears in Charles Plummer's The Governance of England (an 1885 translation from a 15th-century Latin manuscript by John Fortescue, also known as The Difference between an Absolute and a Limited Monarchy).",politics
" This usage of ""governance"" to refer to the arrangements of governing became orthodox including in Sidney Low's seminal text of the same title in 1904 and among some later British constitutional historians.",politics
"However, the use of the term governance in its current broader sense, encompassing the activities of a wide range of public and private institutions, acquired general currency only as recently as the 1990s, when it was re-minted by economists and political scientists and disseminated by institutions such as the UN, the IMF and the World Bank.",politics
"Governance often refers to a particular level of governance associated with a type of organization (including public governance, global governance, non-profit governance, corporate governance, and project governance), a particular 'field' of governance associated with a type of activity or outcome (including environmental governance, internet governance, and information technology governance), or a particular 'model' of governance, often derived as an empirical or normative theory (including regulatory governance, participatory governance, multilevel governance, metagovernance, and collaborative governance).",politics
" Normative concepts of fair governance or good governance are common among political, public sector, voluntary, and private sector organizations.",politics
"In its most abstract sense, governance is a theoretical concept referring to the actions and processes by which stable practices and organizations arise and persist.",politics
" These actions and processes may operate in formal and informal organizations of any size; and they may function for any purpose, good or evil, for profit or not.",politics
" Conceiving of governance in this way, one can apply the concept to states, to corporations, to non-profits, to NGOs, to partnerships and other associations, to business relationships (especially complex outsourcing relationships), to project teams, and to any number of humans engaged in some purposeful activity.",politics
Most theories of governance as process arose out of neoclassical economics.,politics
" These theories build deductive models, based on the assumptions of modern economics, to show how rational actors may come to establish and sustain formal organizations, including firms and states, and informal organizations, such as networks and practices for governing the commons.",politics
There is a distinction between the concepts of governance and politics.,politics
" Politics involves processes by which a group of people (perhaps with divergent opinions or interests) reach collective decisions generally regarded as binding on the group, and enforced as common policy.",politics
" Governance, on the other hand, conveys the administrative and process-oriented elements of governing rather than its antagonistic ones.",politics
" Such an argument continues to assume the possibility of the traditional separation between ""politics"" and ""administration"".",politics
" Contemporary governance practice and theory sometimes questions this distinction, premising that both ""governance"" and ""politics"" involve aspects of power and accountability.",politics
"In general terms, public governance occurs in three broad ways:
",politics
"Through networks involving public-private partnerships (PPP) or with the collaboration of community organisations;
",politics
"Through the use of market mechanisms whereby market principles of competition serve to allocate resources while operating under government regulation;
",politics
Through top-down methods that primarily involve governments and the state bureaucracy.,politics
"Private governance occurs when non-governmental entities, including private organizations, dispute resolution organizations, or other third party groups, make rules and/or standards which have a binding effect on the ""quality of life and opportunities of the larger public.",politics
"""  Simply put, private—not public—entities are making public policy.",politics
" For example, insurance companies exert a great societal impact, largely invisible and freely accepted, that is a private form of governance in society; in turn, reinsurers, as private companies, may exert similar private governance over their underlying carriers.",politics
" The term ""public policy"" should not be exclusively associated with policy that is made by government.",politics
 Public policy may be created by either the private sector or the public sector.,politics
" If one wishes to refer only to public policy that is made by government, the best term to use is ""governmental policy,"" which eliminates the ambiguity regarding the agent of the policy making.",politics
"Global governance is defined as ""the complex of formal and informal institutions, mechanisms, relationships, and processes between and among states, markets, citizens and organizations, both inter- and non-governmental, through which collective interests on the global plane are articulated, right and obligations are established, and differences are mediated"".",politics
" In contrast to the traditional meaning of ""governance"", some authors like James Rosenau have used the term ""global governance"" to denote the regulation of interdependent relations in the absence of an overarching political authority.",politics
 The best example of this is the international system or relationships between independent states.,politics
" The term, however, can apply wherever a group of free equals needs to form a regular relationship.",politics
"The Governance Analytical Framework (GAF) is a practical methodology for investigating governance processes, where various stakeholders interact and make decisions regarding collective issues, thus creating or reinforcing social norms and institutions.",politics
" It is postulated that governance processes can be found in any society, and unlike other approaches, that these can be observed and analysed from a non-normative perspective.",politics
" It proposes a methodology based on five main analytical units: problems, actors, norms, processes and ""nodal points"".",politics
 These logically articulated analytical units make up a coherent methodology aimed at being used as a tool for empirical social policy research.,politics
Nonprofit governance has a dual focus: achieving the organization's social mission and ensuring the organization is viable.,politics
" Both responsibilities relate to fiduciary responsibility that a board of trustees (sometimes called directors, or Board, or Management Committee—the terms are interchangeable) has with respect to the exercise of authority over the explicit actions the organization takes.",politics
 Public trust and accountability is an essential aspect of organizational viability so it achieves the social mission in a way that is respected by those whom the organization serves and the society in which it is located.,politics
"Corporate organizations often use the word governance to describe both:
",politics
"The manner in which boards or their like direct a corporation
",politics
"The laws and customs (rules) applying to that directionCorporate governance consists of the set of processes, customs, policies, laws and institutions affecting the way people direct, administer or control a corporation.",politics
 Corporate governance also includes the relationships among the many players involved (the stakeholders) and the corporate goals.,politics
" The principal players include the shareholders, management, and the board of directors.",politics
" Other stakeholders include employees, suppliers, customers, banks and other lenders, regulators, the environment and the community at large.",politics
"The first documented use of the word ""corporate governance"" is by Richard Eells (1960, p.",politics
" 108) to denote ""the structure and functioning of the corporate polity"".",politics
" The ""corporate government"" concept itself is older and was already used in finance textbooks at the beginning of the 20th century (Becht, Bolton, Röell 2004).",politics
Project governance is the management framework within which project decisions are made.,politics
 Its role is to provide a repeatable and robust system through which an organization can manage its capital investments—project governance handles tasks such as outlining the relationships between all groups involved and describing the flow of information to all stakeholders.,politics

Land governance is concerned with issues of land ownership and tenure.,politics
" It consists of the policies, processes and institutions by which decisions about the access to, use of and control over land are made, implemented and enforced; it is also about managing and reconciling competing claims on land.",politics
" In developing countries, it is relevant as a tool to contribute to equitable and sustainable development, addressing the phenomenon that is known as ‘land grabbing’.",politics
 The operational dimension of land governance is land administration.,politics
"Security of land tenure is considered to contribute to poverty reduction and food security, since it can enable farmers to fully participate in the economy.",politics
" Without recognized property rights, it is hard for small entrepreneurs, farmers included, to obtain credit or sell their business – hence the relevance of comprehensive land governance.",politics
There is constant feedback between land tenure problems and land governance.,politics
" For instance, it has been argued that what is frequently called 'land grabbing', was partly made possible by the Washington Consensus-inspired liberalization of land markets in developing countries.",politics
" Many land acquisition deals were perceived to have negative consequences, and this in turn led to initiatives to improve land governance in developing countries.",politics
"The quality of land governance depends on its practical implementation, which is known as land administration: ‘the way in which rules of land tenure are made operational’.",politics
 And another factor is accountability:  the degree to which citizens and stakeholder groups are consulted and can hold to account their authorities.,politics
"The main international policy initiative to improve land governance is known as the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security (VGGT), endorsed by the Committee on World Food Security (CFS).",politics
"According to the WHO, ""governance in the health sector refers to a wide range of steering and rule-making related functions carried out by governments/decisions makers as they seek to achieve national health policy objectives that are conducive to universal health coverage.",politics
""" A national health policy is a complex and dynamic process, which changes from State to State according to the political, historical and socio-economic situation prevailing in the country.",politics
" Mainly it seeks to strengthen the health system, making sure that they are capable of meeting the health needs of targeted populations.",politics
"More broadly, health governance requires a synergistic set of policies, many of which reside in sectors other than health as well as governors beyond the national governments, which must be supported by structures and mechanisms that enable collaboration.",politics
" For instance, in the European context, it was developed a health policy framework called Health 2020 as a result of the collaboration between State members in the region.",politics
" It gives policy-makers a vision, a strategic path and a set of priorities to improve health, guaranteeing that it is more equitable and sustainable.",politics
", changing population demographics and epidemiology, widening social inequalities, and a context of financial uncertainty) have influenced health system priorities and subsequently the setting of the health governance function.",politics
 These trends have resulted in the emergence of joint actions of all stakeholders to achieve seminal changes in 21st-century societies.,politics
" It is also important to consider that people have witnessed a global shift from traditional and reactive healthcare to proactive care, mainly enabled by investment in advanced technologies.",politics
" Recent artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning have made possible the automation as well as the standardisation of many processes in healthcare, which have also brought to light challenges to the existing governance structures.",politics
 One of these challenges concerns the ownership of health data.,politics
"Internet governance was defined by the World Summit on the Information Society as ""the development and application by Governments, the private sector and civil society, in their respective roles, of shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet.",politics
""" Internet governance deals with how much influence each sector of society should have on the development of the Internet, such as to what extent the state should be able to censor it, and how issues on the Internet, such as cyber-bullying, should be approached.",politics
IT governance primarily deals with connections between business focus and IT management.,politics
 The goal of clear governance is to assure that investment in IT generates business value and mitigates the risks that are associated with IT projects.,politics
Blockchains offer a novel way to enforce agreements and achieve cooperation and coordination.,politics
" The main technical features of blockchains support transparency and traceability of records, information immutability and reliability, and autonomous enforcement of agreements.",politics
" As such, blockchains will affect traditional forms of governance—most notably, contractual and relational governance—and may change the way to organize collaborations between individuals and between organizations.",politics
 Blockchain governance relies on a set of protocols and code-based rules.,politics
" As an original governance mode, it departs from an enforcement through the law (as in contractual governance) or through the value of future relationships (as in relational governance).",politics
Regulatory governance reflects the emergence of decentered and mutually adaptive policy regimes which rests on regulation rather than service provision or taxing and spending.,politics
 The term captures the tendency of policy regimes to deal with complexity with delegated system of rules.,politics
" It is likely to appear in arenas and nations which are more complex, more global, more contested and more liberally democratic.",politics
 The term builds upon and extends the terms of the regulatory state on the one hand and governance on the other.,politics
" While the term regulatory state marginalize non-state actors (NGOs and Business) in the domestic and global level, the term governance marginalizes regulation as a constitutive instrument of governance.",politics
 The term regulatory governance therefore allows us to understand governance beyond the state and governance via regulation.,politics
Participatory governance focuses on deepening democratic engagement through the participation of citizens in the processes of governance with the state.,politics
 The idea is that citizens should play a more direct roles in public decision-making or at least engage more deeply with political issues.,politics
 Government officials should also be responsive to this kind of engagement.,politics
" In practice, participatory governance can supplement the roles of citizens as voters or as watchdogs through more direct forms of involvement.",politics
") Emerging thinking about contract governance is focusing on creating a governance structure in which the parties have a vested interest in managing what are often highly complex contractual arrangements in a more collaborative, aligned, flexible, and credible way.",politics
" In 1979, Nobel laureate Oliver Williamson wrote that the governance structure for a contract is the ""framework within which the integrity of a transaction is decided"", adding further that ""because contracts are varied and complex, governance structures vary with the nature of the transaction.",politics
Multi-level governance is the concept and study of the fact that many intertangled authority structures are present in a global political economy.,politics
" The theory of multi-level governance, developed mainly by Liesbet Hooghe and Gary Marks, arose from increasing European integration, particularly through the European Union.",politics
" José Manuel Barroso, former President of the European Commission, has stated that ""the multilevel system of governance on which our European regional policy is based provides a key boost to the Union's competitive edge"" and that, in times of economic crisis, ""multilevel governance must be a priority.",politics
" It represents the established ethical principles, or 'norms', that shape and steer the entire governing process.",politics
" It is important to note that there are no clearly defined settings within which metagoverning takes place, or particular persons who are responsible for it.",politics
" While some believe metagovernance to be the role of the state which is assumed to want to steer actors in a particular direction, it can ""potentially be exercised by any resourceful actor"" who wishes to influence the governing process.",politics
" Examples of this include the publishing of codes of conduct at the highest level of international government, and media focus on specific issues at the sociocultural level.",politics
" Despite their different sources, both seek to establish values in such a way that they become accepted 'norms'.",politics
" The fact that 'norms' can be established at any level and can then be used to shape the governance process as whole, means metagovernance is part of both the input and the output of the governing system.",politics
"A collaborative governance framework uses a relationship management structure, joint performance and transformation management processes and an exit management plan as controlling mechanisms to encourage the organizations to make ethical, proactive changes for the mutual benefit of all the parties.",politics
Security sector governance (SSG) is a subpart concept or framework of security governance that focuses specifically on decisions about security and their implementation within the security sector of a single state.,politics
 SSG applies the principles of good governance to the security sector in question.,politics
"When discussing governance in particular organizations, the quality of governance within the organization is often compared to a standard of good governance.",politics
" In the case of a business or of a non-profit organization, for example, good governance relates to consistent management, cohesive policies, guidance, processes and decision-rights for a given area of responsibility, and proper oversight and accountability.",politics
" ""Good governance"" implies that mechanisms function in a way that allows the executives (the ""agents"") to respect the rights and interests of the stakeholders (the ""principals""), in a spirit of democracy.",politics
Good governance is an indeterminate term used in international development literature to describe various normative accounts of how public institutions ought to conduct public affairs and manage public resources.,politics
" These normative accounts are often justified on the grounds that they are thought to be conducive to economic ends, such as the eradication of poverty and successful economic development.",politics
 Unsurprisingly different organizations have defined governance and good governance differently to promote different normative ends.,politics
the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country's economic and social resources for development.,politics
"The Worldwide Governance Indicators project of the World Bank defines governance as:
",politics
the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised.,politics
"This considers the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies and the respect of citizens and the state of the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them.",politics
"the use of institutions, structures of authority and even collaboration to allocate resources and coordinate or control activity in society or the economy.",politics
"According to the United Nations Development Programme's Regional Project on Local Governance for Latin America:
",politics
Governance has been defined as the rules of the political system to solve conflicts between actors and adopt decision (legality).,politics
" It has also been used to describe the ""proper functioning of institutions and their acceptance by the public"" (legitimacy).",politics
 And it has been used to invoke the efficacy of government and the achievement of consensus by democratic means (participation).,politics
The effectiveness of governments is not a straightforward and consentient type of governance.,politics
 Measurement and conceptualization of effectiveness is controversial and often used interchangeably with good governance.,politics
" However, during the period of 1996–2018, an effort was made by the World Bank to create a comparable measure of the performance of governments; the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI).",politics
" The WGI is constituted by over 30 databases which are rescaled and categorized into six categories, among one of these is government effectiveness.",politics
" According to this category, effective governance is composed by five aspects: the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service, the degree of the government's independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies.",politics
" In short, effective governance is about quality of service, the independence of government and the quality of policies and implementation.",politics
"Adding to these components, one might argue that responsiveness to citizen's needs is high in an effective government.",politics
" Acting according to these needs, effectiveness is achieved by transparent, decentralized and neutral structures, that are consistent and disciplined.",politics
" Therefore, efficient financial management, high-quality and committed personnel and formalized and standardized ways of processes is needed.",politics
" For the latter, governments became much more efficient with the arise of bureaucracies.",politics
" Nevertheless, governments in a rapidly changing environment need to be able to adapt quickly, so being bounded by rigid structures of functioning could work as a detriment.",politics
"Since the conceptualization of effective governance is not onefold, some more components that might constitute it are suggested: “It should be small in extent with limited intervention in the economy; a clear vision and processes; committed quality personnel that can formulate and implement policies and projects; comprehensive participation with the public; efficient financial management; responsive, transparent and decentralized structures and political stability”.",politics
"The components of effective governance described above all have a domestic character, within the boundaries of the national territory, national policies and about the inhabitants of a country.",politics
" This is the internal aspect of effective governance, which mainly focuses on national services and policies.",politics
" The external aspect of effective governance on the other hand, exclusively focuses on the international domain of politics.",politics
" It entails the state's capacity to exercise its rights and fulfil its duties in alignment with international law, the representation of its people in the international political landscape and its participation in international relations.",politics
The purpose of effective governance in the internal aspect is to be the sovereign within its national territory; in the external aspect to wield sovereignty over international relations.,politics
" For this reason, it is a necessary characteristic of the state to have unrestricted capacity to act, without any form of dependence in both state and international law.",politics
"In an attempt to identify predictors of effective government, a study was done to investigate what characteristics of the state are more deeply established by effective governance.",politics
" The most striking conclusion was that effective governance has a big share in the economic growth and developing, although on the long term.",politics
" However, this is a bi-directional relationship: economic growth does lead to more effective governance as well.",politics
" Moreover, effective governance does have a positive influence on reducing corruption, strengthening political stability, contribution to improved rule of law and improved government spending and accountability.",politics
" As is the case with economic development, it is plausible the argue that effective governance and the named predictors are a positive feedback cycle: they reinforce each other, and so indirectly themselves.",politics
"When a state fails to govern effectively, this does not simply imply the absence of the characteristics of effective governance.",politics
" First of all, the absence of effective governance is lack of capacity of the state to supply its inhabitants with political goods, such as rights and freedoms.",politics
" Zartman describes how absence of effective governance comes about: “as the disintegration ofstate structure, authority (legitimate power), law, and political order”.",politics
" Five main characteristics are to be differentiated in the absence of effective governance: disorganizing of the structure of the processes in the state, violent conflicts, violations of human rights and social fragmentation, all of which have an endogenous character.",politics
"Since the early years of the 2000s (decade), efforts have been conducted in the research and international development community to assess and measure the quality of governance of countries all around the world.",politics
 Measuring governance is inherently a controversial and somewhat political exercise.,politics
" A distinction is therefore made between external assessments, peer assessments and self-assessments.",politics
 Examples of external assessments are donor assessments or comparative indices produced by international non-governmental organizations.,politics
 An example of a peer assessment is the African Peer Review Mechanism.,politics
" Examples of self-assessments are country-led assessments that can be led by government, civil society, researchers and/or other stakeholders at the national level.",politics
"One of these efforts to create an internationally comparable measure of governance and an example of an external assessment is the Worldwide Governance Indicators project, developed by members of the World Bank and the World Bank Institute.",politics
" The project reports aggregate and individual indicators for more than 200 countries for six dimensions of governance: voice and accountability, political stability and lack of violence, government effectiveness, regulatory quality, rule of law, control of corruption.",politics
" To complement the macro-level cross-country Worldwide Governance Indicators, the World Bank Institute developed the World Bank Governance Surveys, which are country-level governance assessment tools that operate at the micro or sub-national level and use information gathered from a country's own citizens, business people and public sector workers to diagnose governance vulnerabilities and suggest concrete approaches for fighting corruption.",politics
A Worldwide Governance Index (WGI) was developed in 2009 and is open for improvement through public participation.,politics
" The following domains, in the form of indicators and composite indexes, were selected to achieve the development of the WGI: Peace and Security, Rule of Law, Human Rights and Participation, Sustainable Development, and Human Development.",politics
" Additionally, in 2009 the Bertelsmann Foundation published the Sustainable Governance Indicators (SGI), which systematically measure the need for reform and the capacity for reform within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries.",politics
" The project examines to what extent governments can identify, formulate and implement effective reforms that render a society well-equipped to meet future challenges, and ensure their future viability.",politics
 Section 10 of the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) Modernization Act requires U.,politics
 federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format.,politics

 A number of books on terrorism were published in the 1970s.,terrorism
 The topic came further to the fore after the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings and again after the 2001 September 11 attacks and the 2002 Bali bombings.,terrorism
In 2006 it was estimated that there were over 109 different definitions of terrorism.,terrorism
" American political philosopher Michael Walzer in 2002 wrote: ""Terrorism is the deliberate killing of innocent people, at random, to spread fear through a whole population and force the hand of its political leaders"".",terrorism
" Bruce Hoffman, an American scholar, has noted that it is not only individual agencies within the same governmental apparatus that cannot agree on a single definition of terrorism.",terrorism
 Experts and other long-established scholars in the field are equally incapable of reaching a consensus.,terrorism
" Coady has written that the question of how to define terrorism is ""irresolvable"" because ""its natural home is in polemical, ideological and propagandist contexts"".",terrorism
"Experts disagree about ""whether terrorism is wrong by definition or just wrong as a matter of fact; they disagree about whether terrorism should be defined in terms of its aims, or its methods, or both, or neither; they disagree about whether states can perpetrate terrorism; they even disagree about the importance or otherwise of terror for a definition of terrorism.",terrorism
State terrorism refers to acts of terrorism conducted by a state against its own citizens or against another state.,terrorism
"In November 2004, a Secretary-General of the United Nations report described terrorism as any act ""intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act"".",terrorism
" The international community has been slow to formulate a universally agreed, legally binding definition of this crime.",terrorism
" These difficulties arise from the fact that the term ""terrorism"" is politically and emotionally charged.",terrorism
" In this regard, Angus Martyn, briefing the Australian parliament, stated,
",terrorism
The international community has never succeeded in developing an accepted comprehensive definition of terrorism.,terrorism
" During the 1970s and 1980s, the United Nations attempts to define the term floundered mainly due to differences of opinion between various members about the use of violence in the context of conflicts over national liberation and self-determination.",terrorism
"These divergences have made it impossible for the United Nations to conclude a Comprehensive Convention on International Terrorism that incorporates a single, all-encompassing, legally binding, criminal law definition of terrorism.",terrorism
 The international community has adopted a series of sectoral conventions that define and criminalize various types of terrorist activities.,terrorism
"Since 1994, the United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts using the following political description of terrorism:
",terrorism
"Criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or any other nature that may be invoked to justify them.",terrorism
Various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions of terrorism in their national legislation.,terrorism
" Code Title 22 Chapter 38, Section 2656f(d) defines terrorism as:
",terrorism
"""Premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents"".",terrorism
" § 2331 defines ""international terrorism"" and ""domestic terrorism"" for purposes of Chapter 113B of the Code, entitled ""Terrorism"":
",terrorism
"""International terrorism"" means activities with the following three characteristics:
",terrorism
"Involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state law;
",terrorism
"Appear to be intended (i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and
",terrorism
occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.,terrorism
", or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.",terrorism
A definition proposed by Carsten Bockstette at the George C.,terrorism
" Marshall European Center for Security Studies, underlines the psychological and tactical aspects of terrorism:
",terrorism
Terrorism is defined as political violence in an asymmetrical conflict that is designed to induce terror and psychic fear (sometimes indiscriminate) through the violent victimization and destruction of noncombatant targets (sometimes iconic symbols).,terrorism
 Such acts are meant to send a message from an illicit clandestine organization.,terrorism
 The purpose of terrorism is to exploit the media in order to achieve maximum attainable publicity as an amplifying force multiplier in order to influence the targeted audience(s) in order to reach short- and midterm political goals and/or desired long-term end states.,terrorism
"Terrorists attack national symbols, which may negatively affect a government, while increasing the prestige of the given terrorist group or its ideology.",terrorism
" Some official, governmental definitions of terrorism use the criterion of the illegitimacy or unlawfulness of the act.",terrorism
" to distinguish between actions authorized by a government (and thus ""lawful"") and those of other actors, including individuals and small groups.",terrorism
" For example, carrying out a strategic bombing on an enemy city, which is designed to affect civilian support for a cause, would not be considered terrorism if it were authorized by a government.",terrorism
" This criterion is inherently problematic and is not universally accepted, because: it denies the existence of state terrorism.",terrorism
"According to Ali Khan, the distinction lies ultimately in a political judgment.",terrorism
"Having the moral charge in our vocabulary of 'something morally wrong', the term 'terrorism' is often used to abuse or denounce opposite parties, either governments or non-state groups.",terrorism
"Those labeled ""terrorists"" by their opponents rarely identify themselves as such, and typically use other terms or terms specific to their situation, such as separatist, freedom fighter, liberator, revolutionary, vigilante, militant, paramilitary, guerrilla, rebel, patriot, or any similar-meaning word in other languages and cultures.",terrorism
" Jihadi, mujahideen, and fedayeen are similar Arabic words that have entered the English lexicon.",terrorism
 It is common for both parties in a conflict to describe each other as terrorists.,terrorism
"On whether particular terrorist acts, such as killing non-combatants, can be justified as the lesser evil in a particular circumstance, philosophers have expressed different views: while, according to David Rodin, utilitarian philosophers can (in theory) conceive of cases in which the evil of terrorism is outweighed by the good that could not be achieved in a less morally costly way, in practice the ""harmful effects of undermining the convention of non-combatant immunity is thought to outweigh the goods that may be achieved by particular acts of terrorism"".",terrorism
" Among the non-utilitarian philosophers, Michael Walzer argued that terrorism can be morally justified in only one specific case: when ""a nation or community faces the extreme threat of complete destruction and the only way it can preserve itself is by intentionally targeting non-combatants, then it is morally entitled to do so"".",terrorism
"In his book Inside Terrorism Bruce Hoffman offered an explanation of why the term terrorism becomes distorted:
",terrorism
"On one point, at least, everyone agrees: terrorism is a pejorative term.",terrorism
" It is a word with intrinsically negative connotations that is generally applied to one's enemies and opponents, or to those with whom one disagrees and would otherwise prefer to ignore.",terrorism
" 'What is called terrorism,' Brian Jenkins has written, 'thus seems to depend on one's point of view.",terrorism
" Use of the term implies a moral judgment; and if one party can successfully attach the label terrorist to its opponent, then it has indirectly persuaded others to adopt its moral viewpoint.",terrorism
"' Hence the decision to call someone or label some organization terrorist becomes almost unavoidably subjective, depending largely on whether one sympathizes with or opposes the person/group/cause concerned.",terrorism
" If one identifies with the victim of the violence, for example, then the act is terrorism.",terrorism
" If, however, one identifies with the perpetrator, the violent act is regarded in a more sympathetic, if not positive (or, at the worst, an ambivalent) light; and it is not terrorism.",terrorism
"The pejorative connotations of the word can be summed up in the aphorism, ""One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter"".",terrorism
" This is exemplified when a group using irregular military methods is an ally of a state against a mutual enemy, but later falls out with the state and starts to use those methods against its former ally.",terrorism
" During the Second World War, the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army were allied with the British, but during the Malayan Emergency, members of its successor organisation (the Malayan Races Liberation Army) started campaigns against them, and were branded ""terrorists"" as a result.",terrorism
" More recently, Ronald Reagan and others in the American administration frequently called the mujaheddin ""freedom fighters"" during the Soviet–Afghan War yet twenty years later, when a new generation of Afghan men were fighting against what they perceive to be a regime installed by foreign powers, their attacks were labelled ""terrorism"" by George W.",terrorism
 Groups accused of terrorism understandably prefer terms reflecting legitimate military or ideological action.,terrorism
" Leading terrorism researcher Professor Martin Rudner, director of the Canadian Centre of Intelligence and Security Studies at Ottawa's Carleton University, defines ""terrorist acts"" as unlawful attacks for political or other ideological goals, and said:
",terrorism
There is the famous statement: 'One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter.,terrorism
 It assesses the validity of the cause when terrorism is an act.,terrorism
" One can have a perfectly beautiful cause and yet if one commits terrorist acts, it is terrorism regardless.",terrorism
"Some groups, when involved in a ""liberation"" struggle, have been called ""terrorists"" by the Western governments or media.",terrorism
" Later, these same persons, as leaders of the liberated nations, are called ""statesmen"" by similar organizations.",terrorism
 Two examples of this phenomenon are the Nobel Peace Prize laureates Menachem Begin and Nelson Mandela.,terrorism
" WikiLeaks editor Julian Assange has been called a ""terrorist"" by Sarah Palin and Joe Biden.",terrorism
"Sometimes, states that are close allies, for reasons of history, culture and politics, can disagree over whether members of a certain organization are terrorists.",terrorism
" For instance, for many years, some branches of the United States government refused to label members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) as terrorists while the IRA was using methods against one of the United States' closest allies (the United Kingdom) that the UK branded as terrorism.",terrorism
"Media outlets who wish to convey impartiality may limit their usage of ""terrorist"" and ""terrorism"" because they are loosely defined, potentially controversial in nature, and subjective terms.",terrorism
"Depending on how broadly the term is defined, the roots and practice of terrorism can be traced at least to the 1st century AD.",terrorism
" Sicarii Zealots, though some dispute whether the group, a radical offshoot of the Zealots which was active in Judaea Province at the beginning of the 1st century AD, was in fact terrorist.",terrorism
" According to the contemporary Jewish-Roman historian Josephus, after the Zealotry rebellion against Roman rule in Judea, when some prominent Jewish collaborators with Roman rule were killed, Judas of Galilee formed a small and more extreme offshoot of the Zealots, the Sicarii, in 6 AD.",terrorism
" Their terror was directed against Jewish ""collaborators"", including temple priests, Sadducees, Herodians, and other wealthy elites.",terrorism
"The term ""terrorism"" itself was originally used to describe the actions of the Jacobin Club during the ""Reign of Terror"" in the French Revolution.",terrorism
" ""Terror is nothing other than justice, prompt, severe, inflexible"", said Jacobin leader Maximilien Robespierre.",terrorism
" In 1795, Edmund Burke denounced the Jacobins for letting ""thousands of those hell-hounds called Terrorists .",terrorism
"In January 1858, Italian patriot Felice Orsini threw three bombs in an attempt to assassinate French Emperor Napoleon III.",terrorism
 The incident played a crucial role as an inspiration for the development of the early terrorist groups.,terrorism
"Arguably the first organization to utilize modern terrorist techniques was the Irish Republican Brotherhood, founded in 1858 as a revolutionary Irish nationalist group that carried out attacks in England.",terrorism
" The group initiated the Fenian dynamite campaign in 1881, one of the first modern terror campaigns.",terrorism
" Instead of earlier forms of terrorism based on political assassination, this campaign used timed explosives with the express aim of sowing fear in the very heart of metropolitan Britain, in order to achieve political gains.",terrorism
"Another early terrorist group was Narodnaya Volya, founded in Russia in 1878 as a revolutionary anarchist group inspired by Sergei Nechayev and ""propaganda by the deed"" theorist Carlo Pisacane.",terrorism
" The group developed ideas—such as targeted killing of the 'leaders of oppression'—that were to become the hallmark of subsequent violence by small non-state groups, and they were convinced that the developing technologies of the age—such as the invention of dynamite, which they were the first anarchist group to make widespread use of—enabled them to strike directly and with discrimination.",terrorism
"David Rapoport refers to four major waves of global terrorism: ""the Anarchist, the Anti-Colonial, the New Left, and the Religious.",terrorism
 The first three have been completed and lasted around 40 years; the fourth is now in its third decade.,terrorism
"Depending on the country, the political system, and the time in history, the types of terrorism are varying.",terrorism
"In early 1975, the Law Enforcement Assistant Administration in the United States formed the National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and Goals.",terrorism
" One of the five volumes that the committee wrote was titled Disorders and Terrorism, produced by the Task Force on Disorders and Terrorism under the direction of H.",terrorism
"The Task Force defines terrorism as ""a tactic or technique by means of which a violent act or the threat thereof is used for the prime purpose of creating overwhelming fear for coercive purposes"".",terrorism
" It classified disorders and terrorism into six categories:
",terrorism
"Civil disorder – A form of collective violence interfering with the peace, security, and normal functioning of the community.",terrorism
"Political terrorism – Violent criminal behaviour designed primarily to generate fear in the community, or substantial segment of it, for political purposes.",terrorism
"Non-Political terrorism – Terrorism that is not aimed at political purposes but which exhibits ""conscious design to create and maintain a high degree of fear for coercive purposes, but the end is individual or collective gain rather than the achievement of a political objective"".",terrorism
"Anonymous terrorism – In the two decades prior to 2016-19, ""fewer than half"" of all terrorist attacks were either ""claimed by their perpetrators or convincingly attributed by governments to specific terrorist groups"".",terrorism
 A number of theory have been advanced as to why this has happened.,terrorism
Quasi-terrorism – The activities incidental to the commission of crimes of violence that are similar in form and method to genuine terrorism but which nevertheless lack its essential ingredient.,terrorism
" It is not the main purpose of the quasi-terrorists to induce terror in the immediate victim as in the case of genuine terrorism, but the quasi-terrorist uses the modalities and techniques of the genuine terrorist and produces similar consequences and reaction.",terrorism
" For example, the fleeing felon who takes hostages is a quasi-terrorist, whose methods are similar to those of the genuine terrorist but whose purposes are quite different.",terrorism
"Limited political terrorism – Genuine political terrorism is characterized by a revolutionary approach; limited political terrorism refers to ""acts of terrorism which are committed for ideological or political motives but which are not part of a concerted campaign to capture control of the state"".",terrorism
"Official or state terrorism – ""referring to nations whose rule is based upon fear and oppression that reach similar to terrorism or such proportions"".",terrorism
" It may be referred to as Structural Terrorism defined broadly as terrorist acts carried out by governments in pursuit of political objectives, often as part of their foreign policy.",terrorism
"Other sources have defined the typology of terrorism in different ways, for example, broadly classifying it into domestic terrorism and international terrorism, or using categories such as vigilante terrorism or insurgent terrorism.",terrorism
"Individuals and groups choose terrorism as a tactic because it can:
",terrorism
"Act as a form of asymmetric warfare in order to directly force a government to agree to demands
",terrorism
"Intimidate a group of people into capitulating to the demands in order to avoid future injury
",terrorism
"Directly inspire more people to the cause (such as revolutionary acts) – propaganda of the deed
",terrorism
"Indirectly inspire more people to the cause by provoking a hostile response or over-reaction from enemies to the causeAttacks on ""collaborators"" are used to intimidate people from cooperating with the state in order to undermine state control.",terrorism
" This strategy was used in Ireland, in Kenya, in Algeria and in Cyprus during their independence struggles.",terrorism
Stated motives for the September 11 attacks included inspiring more fighters to join the cause of repelling the United States from Muslim countries with a successful high-profile attack.,terrorism
 The attacks prompted some criticism from domestic and international observers regarding perceived injustices in U.,terrorism
" foreign policy that provoked the attacks, but the larger practical effect was that the United States government declared a War on Terror that resulted in substantial military engagements in several Muslim-majority countries.",terrorism
" Various commentators have inferred that al-Qaeda expected a military response, and welcomed it as a provocation that would result in more Muslims fight the United States.",terrorism
 Some commentators believe that the resulting anger and suspicion directed toward innocent Muslims living in Western countries and the indignities inflicted upon them by security forces and the general public also contributes to radicalization of new recruits.,terrorism
" Despite criticism that the Iraqi government had no involvement with the September 11 attacks, Bush declared the 2003 invasion of Iraq to be part of the War on Terror.",terrorism
" The resulting backlash and instability enabled the rise of Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the temporary creation of an Islamic caliphate holding territory in Iraq and Syria, until ISIL lost its territory through military defeats.",terrorism
Attacks used to draw international attention to struggles that are otherwise unreported have included the Palestinian airplane hijackings in 1970 and the 1975 Dutch train hostage crisis.,terrorism
"Adoption of a particular political philosophy, such as socialism (left-wing terrorism), anarchism, or fascism (possibly through a coup or as an ideology of an independence or separatist movement)
",terrorism
"Preventing a rival group from sharing or occupying a particular territory (such as by discouraging immigration or encouraging flight)
",terrorism
"Subjugation of a particular population (such as lynching of African Americans)
",terrorism
"Spread or dominance of a particular religion – religious terrorism
",terrorism
"Responding to a violent act (for example, tit-for-tat attacks in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, in The Troubles in Northern Ireland, or Timothy McVeigh's revenge for the Waco siege and Ruby Ridge incident)Causes for right-wing terrorism have included white nationalism, ethnonationalism, fascism, anti-socialism, the anti-abortion movement, and tax resistance.",terrorism
Sometimes terrorists on the same side fight for different reasons.,terrorism
" For example, in the Chechen–Russian conflict secular Chechens using terrorist tactics fighting for national independence are allied with radical Islamist terrorists who have arrived from other countries.",terrorism
"Various personal and social factors may influence the personal choice of whether to join a terrorist group or attempt an act of terror, including:
",terrorism
"Identity, including affiliation with a particular culture, ethnicity, or religion
",terrorism
"Financial reward (for example, the Palestinian Authority Martyrs Fund)
",terrorism
"Perception that the cause responds to a profound injustice or indignityA report conducted by Paul Gill, John Horgan and Paige Deckert found that for ""lone wolf"" terrorists:

"40% were unemployed at the time of their arrest or terrorist event

"14% percent experienced being the victim of verbal or physical assaultAriel Merari, a psychologist who has studied the psychological profiles of suicide terrorists since 1983 through media reports that contained biographical details, interviews with the suicides' families, and interviews with jailed would-be suicide attackers, concluded that they were unlikely to be psychologically abnormal.",terrorism
" In comparison to economic theories of criminal behaviour, Scott Atran found that suicide terrorists exhibit none of the socially dysfunctional attributes—such as fatherless, friendless, jobless situations—or suicidal symptoms.",terrorism
" By which he means, they do not kill themselves simply out of hopelessness or a sense of 'having nothing to lose'.",terrorism
Abrahm suggests that terrorist organizations do not select terrorism for its political effectiveness.,terrorism
" Individual terrorists tend to be motivated more by a desire for social solidarity with other members of their organization than by political platforms or strategic objectives, which are often murky and undefined.",terrorism
Michael Mousseau shows possible relationships between the type of economy within a country and ideology associated with terrorism.,terrorism
"Terrorism is most common in nations with intermediate political freedom, and it is least common in the most democratic nations.",terrorism
"Some examples of ""terrorism"" in non-democratic nations include ETA in Spain under Francisco Franco (although the group's terrorist activities increased sharply after Franco's death), the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists in pre-war Poland, the Shining Path in Peru under Alberto Fujimori, the Kurdistan Workers Party when Turkey was ruled by military leaders and the ANC in South Africa.",terrorism
" Democracies, such as Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Israel, Indonesia, India, Spain, Germany, Italy and the Philippines, have experienced domestic terrorism.",terrorism
"While a democratic nation espousing civil liberties may claim a sense of higher moral ground than other regimes, an act of terrorism within such a state may cause a dilemma: whether to maintain its civil liberties and thus risk being perceived as ineffective in dealing with the problem; or alternatively to restrict its civil liberties and thus risk delegitimizing its claim of supporting civil liberties.",terrorism
" For this reason, homegrown terrorism has started to be seen as a greater threat, as stated by former CIA Director Michael Hayden.",terrorism
" This dilemma, some social theorists would conclude, may very well play into the initial plans of the acting terrorist(s); namely, to delegitimize the state and cause a systematic shift towards anarchy via the accumulation of negative sentiments towards the state system.",terrorism
"According to the Global Terrorism Index by the University of Maryland, College Park, religious extremism has overtaken national separatism and become the main driver of terrorist attacks around the world.",terrorism
 Since 9/11 there has been a five-fold increase in deaths from terrorist attacks.,terrorism
 The majority of incidents over the past several years can be tied to groups with a religious agenda.,terrorism
" Before 2000, it was nationalist separatist terrorist organizations such as the IRA and Chechen rebels who were behind the most attacks.",terrorism
 The number of incidents from nationalist separatist groups has remained relatively stable in the years since while religious extremism has grown.,terrorism
" The prevalence of Islamist groups in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Nigeria and Syria is the main driver behind these trends.",terrorism
"Four of the terrorist groups that have been most active since 2001 are Boko Haram, Al Qaeda, the Taliban and ISIL.",terrorism

" Such attacks have targeted both Muslims and non-Muslims, however the majority affect Muslims themselves.",terrorism
" From the summer of 2007 until late 2009, more than 1,500 people were killed in suicide and other attacks on civilians for reasons attributed to a number of causes—sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Muslims; easy availability of guns and explosives; the existence of a ""Kalashnikov culture""; an influx of ideologically driven Muslims based in or near Pakistan, who originated from various nations around the world and the subsequent war against the pro-Soviet Afghans in the 1980s which blew back into Pakistan; the presence of Islamist insurgent groups and forces such as the Taliban and Lashkar-e-Taiba.",terrorism

 Yuval Harari argues that the peacefulness of modern states makes them paradoxically more vulnerable to terrorism than pre-modern states.,terrorism
" Harari argues that because modern states have committed themselves to reducing political violence to almost zero, terrorists can, by creating political violence, threaten the very foundations of the legitimacy of the modern state.",terrorism
" This is in contrast to pre-modern states, where violence was a routine and recognised aspect of politics at all levels, making political violence unremarkable.",terrorism
" Terrorism thus shocks the population of a modern state far more than a pre-modern one and consequently the state is forced to overreact in an excessive, costly and spectacular manner, which is often what the terrorists desire.",terrorism
The type of people terrorists will target is dependent upon the ideology of the terrorists.,terrorism
" A terrorist's ideology will create a class of ""legitimate targets"" who are deemed as its enemies and who are permitted to be targeted.",terrorism
" This ideology will also allow the terrorists to place the blame on the victim, who is viewed as being responsible for the violence in the first place.",terrorism

 Durban and John Bowlby have argued human beings are inherently violent.,terrorism
" This aggressiveness is fueled by displacement and projection where a person transfers his or her grievances into bias and hatred against other races, religions, nations or ideologies.",terrorism
" By this theory, the nation state preserves order in the local society while creating an outlet for aggression through warfare.",terrorism
"The Italian psychoanalyst Franco Fornari, a follower of Melanie Klein, thought war was the paranoid or projective ""elaboration"" of mourning.",terrorism

" For the adult, nations are the sacred objects that generate warfare.",terrorism
" Fornari focused upon sacrifice as the essence of war: the astonishing willingness of human beings to die for their country, to give over their bodies to their nation.",terrorism
"Despite Fornari's theory that man's altruistic desire for self-sacrifice for a noble cause is a contributing factor towards war, few wars have originated from a desire for war among the general populace.",terrorism
 Far more often the general population has been reluctantly drawn into war by its rulers.,terrorism
 One psychological theory that looks at the leaders is advanced by Maurice Walsh.,terrorism
 He argues the general populace is more neutral towards war and wars occur when leaders with a psychologically abnormal disregard for human life are placed into power.,terrorism
 War is caused by leaders who seek war such as Napoleon and Hitler.,terrorism
" Such leaders most often come to power in times of crisis when the populace opts for a decisive leader, who then leads the nation to war.",terrorism

 the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders.,terrorism
 All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger.,terrorism
Several theories concern the evolutionary origins of warfare.,terrorism
" There are two main schools: One sees organized warfare as emerging in or after the Mesolithic as a result of complex social organization and greater population density and competition over resources; the other sees human warfare as a more ancient practice derived from common animal tendencies, such as territoriality and sexual competition.",terrorism
"The latter school argues that since warlike behavior patterns are found in many primate species such as chimpanzees, as well as in many ant species, group conflict may be a general feature of animal social behavior.",terrorism
" Some proponents of the idea argue that war, while innate, has been intensified greatly by developments of technology and social organization such as weaponry and states.",terrorism
Psychologist and linguist Steven Pinker argued that war-related behaviors may have been naturally selected in the ancestral environment due to the benefits of victory.,terrorism
"  He also argued that in order to have credible deterrence against other groups (as well as on an individual level), it was important to have a reputation for retaliation, causing humans to develop instincts for revenge as well as for protecting a group's (or an individual's) reputation (""honor"").",terrorism
"Crofoot and Wrangham have argued that warfare, if defined as group interactions in which ""coalitions attempt to aggressively dominate or kill members of other groups"", is a characteristic of most human societies.",terrorism
" Those in which it has been lacking ""tend to be societies that were politically dominated by their neighbors"".",terrorism
"Ashley Montagu strongly denied universalistic instinctual arguments, arguing that social factors and childhood socialization are important in determining the nature and presence of warfare.",terrorism
" Thus, he argues, warfare is not a universal human occurrence and appears to have been a historical invention, associated with certain types of human societies.",terrorism
" Montagu's argument is supported by ethnographic research conducted in societies where the concept of aggression seems to be entirely absent, e.",terrorism
" Low has observed correlation between warfare and education, noting societies where warfare is commonplace encourage their children to be more aggressive.",terrorism
War can be seen as a growth of economic competition in a competitive international system.,terrorism
 In this view wars begin as a pursuit of markets for natural resources and for wealth.,terrorism
 War has also been linked to economic development by economic historians and development economists studying state-building and fiscal capacity.,terrorism
" While this theory has been applied to many conflicts, such counter arguments become less valid as the increasing mobility of capital and information level the distributions of wealth worldwide, or when considering that it is relative, not absolute, wealth differences that may fuel wars.",terrorism
" There are those on the extreme right of the political spectrum who provide support, fascists in particular, by asserting a natural right of a strong nation to whatever the weak cannot hold by force.",terrorism
" Some centrist, capitalist, world leaders, including Presidents of the United States and U.",terrorism
"The Marxist theory of war is quasi-economic in that it states all modern wars are caused by competition for resources and markets between great (imperialist) powers, claiming these wars are a natural result of the capitalism, particularly state-monopoly forms.",terrorism
" Part of the theory is that war will disappear once a world revolution, over-throwing capitalism and state power, has occurred.",terrorism
" Marxist economists Karl Kautsky, Rosa Luxemburg, Rudolf Hilferding and Vladimir Lenin theorized that imperialism was the result of capitalist countries needing new markets.",terrorism
 Expansion of the means of production is only possible if there is a corresponding growth in consumer demand.,terrorism
" Since the workers in a capitalist economy would be unable to fill the demand, producers must expand into non-capitalist markets to find consumers for their goods, hence driving imperialism.",terrorism
"Demographic theories can be grouped into two classes, Malthusian and youth bulge theories:

Malthusian theories see expanding population and scarce resources as a source of violent conflict.,terrorism

"According to Heinsohn, who proposed youth bulge theory in its most generalized form, a youth bulge occurs when 30 to 40 percent of the males of a nation belong to the ""fighting age"" cohorts from 15 to 29 years of age.",terrorism
 It will follow periods with total fertility rates as high as 4–8 children per woman with a 15–29-year delay.,terrorism
"Heinsohn saw both past ""Christianist"" European colonialism and imperialism, as well as today's Islamist civil unrest and terrorism as results of high birth rates producing youth bulges.",terrorism
" Among prominent historical events that have been attributed to youth bulges are the role played by the historically large youth cohorts in the rebellion and revolution waves of early modern Europe, including the French Revolution of 1789, and the effect of economic depression upon the largest German youth cohorts ever in explaining the rise of Nazism in Germany in the 1930s.",terrorism
 The 1994 Rwandan genocide has also been analyzed as following a massive youth bulge.,terrorism
"Youth bulge theory has been subjected to statistical analysis by the World Bank, Population Action International, and the Berlin Institute for Population and Development.",terrorism
" Youth bulge theories have been criticized as leading to racial, gender and age discrimination.",terrorism
Rationalism is an international relations theory or framework.,terrorism
" Rationalism (and Neorealism (international relations)) operate under the assumption that states or international actors are rational, seek the best possible outcomes for themselves, and desire to avoid the costs of war.",terrorism
" Under one game theory approach, rationalist theories posit all actors can bargain, would be better off if war did not occur, and likewise seek to understand why war nonetheless reoccurs.",terrorism
" Under another rationalist game theory without bargaining, the peace war game, optimal strategies can still be found that depend upon number of iterations played.",terrorism
" In ""Rationalist Explanations for War"", James Fearon examined three rationalist explanations for why some countries engage in war:
",terrorism
"Commitment problems""Issue indivisibility"" occurs when the two parties cannot avoid war by bargaining, because the thing over which they are fighting cannot be shared between them, but only owned entirely by one side or the other.",terrorism
"""Information asymmetry with incentives to misrepresent"" occurs when two countries have secrets about their individual capabilities, and do not agree on either: who would win a war between them, or the magnitude of state's victory or loss.",terrorism
" For instance, Geoffrey Blainey argues that war is a result of miscalculation of strength.",terrorism
" He cites historical examples of war and demonstrates, ""war is usually the outcome of a diplomatic crisis which cannot be solved because both sides have conflicting estimates of their bargaining power.",terrorism
""" Thirdly, bargaining may fail due to the states' inability to make credible commitments.",terrorism
"Within the rationalist tradition, some theorists have suggested that individuals engaged in war suffer a normal level of cognitive bias, but are still ""as rational as you and me"".",terrorism
" According to philosopher Iain King, ""Most instigators of conflict overrate their chances of success, while most participants underrate their chances of injury.",terrorism
""" King asserts that ""Most catastrophic military decisions are rooted in GroupThink"" which is faulty, but still rational.",terrorism
The rationalist theory focused around bargaining is currently under debate.,terrorism
 The Iraq War proved to be an anomaly that undercuts the validity of applying rationalist theory to some wars.,terrorism
The statistical analysis of war was pioneered by Lewis Fry Richardson following World War I.,terrorism
" More recent databases of wars and armed conflict have been assembled by the Correlates of War Project, Peter Brecke and the Uppsala Conflict Data Program.",terrorism
"The following subsections consider causes of war from system, societal, and individual levels of analysis.",terrorism
" This kind of division was first proposed by Kenneth Waltz in Man, the State, and War and has been often used by political scientists since then.",terrorism
There are several different international relations theory schools.,terrorism
" Supporters of realism in international relations argue that the motivation of states is the quest for security, and conflicts can arise from the inability to distinguish defense from offense, which is called the security dilemma.",terrorism
"Within the realist school as represented by scholars such as Henry Kissinger and Hans Morgenthau, and the neorealist school represented by scholars such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer, two main sub-theories are:
",terrorism
"Balance of power theory: States have the goal of preventing a single state from becoming a hegemon, and war is the result of the would-be hegemon's persistent attempts at power acquisition.",terrorism
" In this view, an international system with more equal distribution of power is more stable, and ""movements toward unipolarity are destabilizing.",terrorism
""" However, evidence has shown power polarity is not actually a major factor in the occurrence of wars.",terrorism
"Power transition theory: Hegemons impose stabilizing conditions on the world order, but they eventually decline, and war occurs when a declining hegemon is challenged by another rising power or aims to preemptively suppress them.",terrorism
" On this view, unlike for balance-of-power theory, wars become more probable when power is more equally distributed.",terrorism
" This ""power preponderance"" hypothesis has empirical support.",terrorism
The two theories are not mutually exclusive and may be used to explain disparate events according to the circumstance.,terrorism
"Liberalism as it relates to international relations emphasizes factors such as trade, and its role in disincentivizing conflict which will damage economic relations.",terrorism
"  Realists respond that military force may sometimes be at least as effective as trade at achieving economic benefits, especially historically if not as much today.",terrorism
" Furthermore, trade relations which result in a high level of dependency may escalate tensions and lead to conflict.",terrorism
" Empirical data on the relationship of trade to peace are mixed, and moreover, some evidence suggests countries at war don't necessarily trade less with each other.",terrorism
"Diversionary theory, also known as the ""scapegoat hypothesis"", suggests the politically powerful may use war to as a diversion or to rally domestic popular support.",terrorism
" This is supported by literature showing out-group hostility enhances in-group bonding, and a significant domestic ""rally effect"" has been demonstrated when conflicts begin.",terrorism
" However, studies examining the increased use of force as a function of need for internal political support are more mixed.",terrorism
 war-time presidential popularity surveys taken during the presidencies of several recent U.,terrorism
"These theories suggest differences in people's personalities, decision-making, emotions, belief systems, and biases are important in determining whether conflicts get out of hand.",terrorism
" For instance, it has been proposed that conflict is modulated by bounded rationality and various cognitive biases, such as prospect theory.",terrorism
The morality of war has been the subject of debate for thousands of years.,terrorism
"The two principal aspects of ethics in war, according to the just war theory, are jus ad bellum and Jus in bello.",terrorism
"Jus ad bellum (right to war), dictates which unfriendly acts and circumstances justify a proper authority in declaring war on another nation.",terrorism
" There are six main criteria for the declaration of a just war: first, any just war must be declared by a lawful authority; second, it must be a just and righteous cause, with sufficient gravity to merit large-scale violence; third, the just belligerent must have rightful intentions – namely, that they seek to advance good and curtail evil; fourth, a just belligerent must have a reasonable chance of success; fifth, the war must be a last resort; and sixth, the ends being sought must be proportional to means being used.",terrorism
"Jus in bello (right in war), is the set of ethical rules when conducting war.",terrorism
 The two main principles are proportionality and discrimination.,terrorism
 Proportionality regards how much force is necessary and morally appropriate to the ends being sought and the injustice suffered.,terrorism
" The principle of discrimination determines who are the legitimate targets in a war, and specifically makes a separation between combatants, who it is permissible to kill, and non-combatants, who it is not.",terrorism
 Failure to follow these rules can result in the loss of legitimacy for the just-war-belligerent.,terrorism
 The just war theory was foundational in the creation of the United Nations and in International Law's regulations on legitimate war.,terrorism
"Fascism, and the ideals it encompasses, such as Pragmatism, racism, and social Darwinism, hold that violence is good.",terrorism
" Pragmatism holds that war and violence can be good if it serves the ends of the people, without regard for universal morality.",terrorism
" Racism holds that violence is good so that a master race can be established, or to purge an inferior race from the earth, or both.",terrorism
 Social Darwinism asserts that violence is sometimes necessary to weed the unfit from society so civilization can flourish.,terrorism
 These are broad archetypes for the general position that the ends justify the means.,terrorism
" conflict theorist and sociologist, argued conflict provides a function and a process whereby a succession of new equilibriums are created.",terrorism
" Thus, the struggle of opposing forces, rather than being disruptive, may be a means of balancing and maintaining a social structure or society.",terrorism
"Religious groups have long formally opposed or sought to limit war as in the Second Vatican Council document Gaudiem et Spes: ""Any act of war aimed indiscriminately at the destruction of entire cities of extensive areas along with their population is a crime against God and man himself.",terrorism
"""Anti-war movements have existed for every major war in the 20th century, including, most prominently, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War.",terrorism
" In the 21st century, worldwide anti-war movements occurred in response to the United States invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq.",terrorism

"Violence is the use of physical force so as to injure, abuse, damage, or destroy.",terrorism
" Other definitions are also used, such as the World Health Organization's definition of violence as ""the intentional use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself, another person, or against a group or community, which either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, maldevelopment, or deprivation.",terrorism
"""Internationally, violence resulted in deaths of an estimated 1.",terrorism
" Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention.",terrorism
" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments.",terrorism
" Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development.",terrorism
"In 2013, of the estimated 405,000 deaths due to interpersonal violence globally, assault by firearm was the cause in 180,000 deaths, assault by sharp object was the cause in 114,000 deaths, and the remaining 110,000 deaths from other causes.",terrorism
" There is a strong relationship between levels of violence and modifiable factors in a country such as an concentrated (regional) poverty, income and gender inequality, the harmful use of alcohol, and the absence of safe, stable, and nurturing relationships between children and parents.",terrorism
" Strategies addressing the underlying causes of violence can be relatively effective in preventing violence, although mental and physical health and individual responses, personalities, etc.",terrorism
 have always been decisive factors in the formation of these behaviors.,terrorism
"The World Health Organization divides violence into three broad categories:
",terrorism
"collective violenceThis initial categorization differentiates between violence that a person inflicts upon themself, violence inflicted by another individual or by a small group of individuals, and violence inflicted by larger groups such as states, organized political groups, militia groups and terrorist organizations.",terrorism
"Alternatively, violence can primarily be classified as either instrumental or reactive / hostile.",terrorism
Self-directed violence is subdivided into suicidal behaviour and self-abuse.,terrorism
" The former includes suicidal thoughts, attempted suicides—also called para suicide or deliberate self-injury in some countries—and completed suicides.",terrorism
" Self-abuse, in contrast, includes acts such as self-mutilation.",terrorism
"Unlike the other two broad categories, the subcategories of collective violence suggest possible motives for violence committed by larger groups of individuals or by states.",terrorism
" Collective violence that is committed to advance a particular social agenda includes, for example, crimes of hate committed by organized groups, terrorist acts and mob violence.",terrorism
" Political violence includes war and related violent conflicts, state violence and similar acts carried out by larger groups.",terrorism
" Economic violence includes attacks by larger groups motivated by economic gain—such as attacks carried out with the purpose of disrupting economic activity, denying access to essential services, or creating economic division and fragmentation.",terrorism
" Clearly, acts committed by larger groups can have multiple motives.",terrorism
"War is a state of prolonged violent large-scale conflict involving two or more groups of people, usually under the auspices of government.",terrorism
"War is fought as a means of resolving territorial and other conflicts, as war of aggression to conquer territory or loot resources, in national self-defence or liberation, or to suppress attempts of part of the nation to secede from it.",terrorism
" There are also ideological, religious and revolutionary wars.",terrorism
Since the Industrial Revolution the lethality of modern warfare has grown.,terrorism
 World War I casualties were over 40 million and World War II casualties were over 70 million.,terrorism
"Interpersonal violence is divided into two subcategories: Family and intimate partner violence—that is, violence largely between family members and intimate partners, usually, though not exclusively, taking place in the home.",terrorism
" Community violence—violence between individuals who are unrelated, and who may or may not know each other, generally taking place outside the home.",terrorism
" The former group includes forms of violence such as child abuse, intimate partner violence and abuse of the elderly.",terrorism
" The latter includes youth violence, random acts of violence, rape or sexual assault by strangers, and violence in institutional settings such as schools, workplaces, prisons and nursing homes.",terrorism
" When interpersonal violence occurs in families, its psychological consequences can affect parents, children, and their relationship in the short- and long-terms.",terrorism
Child maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age.,terrorism
" It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other child exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power.",terrorism
 Exposure to intimate partner violence is also sometimes included as a form of child maltreatment.,terrorism
"Child maltreatment is a global problem with serious lifelong consequences, which is, however, complex and difficult to study.",terrorism
There are no reliable global estimates for the prevalence of child maltreatment.,terrorism
" Data for many countries, especially low- and middle-income countries, are lacking.",terrorism
 Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used.,terrorism
" Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.",terrorism
"Consequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and social and occupational functioning (e.",terrorism
 These can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development.,terrorism
 Preventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible and requires a multisectoral approach.,terrorism
 Effective prevention programmes support parents and teach positive parenting skills.,terrorism
 Ongoing care of children and families can reduce the risk of maltreatment reoccurring and can minimize its consequences.,terrorism
"Following the World Health Organization, youth are defined as people between the ages of 10 and 29 years.",terrorism
" Youth violence refers to violence occurring between youths, and includes acts that range from bullying and physical fighting, through more severe sexual and physical assault to homicide.",terrorism
"Worldwide some 250,000 homicides occur among youth 10–29 years of age each year, which is 41% of the total number of homicides globally each year (""Global Burden of Disease"", World Health Organization, 2008).",terrorism
" For each young person killed, 20–40 more sustain injuries requiring hospital treatment.",terrorism
" Youth violence has a serious, often lifelong, impact on a person's psychological and social functioning.",terrorism
" Youth violence greatly increases the costs of health, welfare and criminal justice services; reduces productivity; decreases the value of property; and generally undermines the fabric of society.",terrorism
"Prevention programmes shown to be effective or to have promise in reducing youth violence include life skills and social development programmes designed to help children and adolescents manage anger, resolve conflict, and develop the necessary social skills to solve problems; schools-based anti-bullying prevention programmes; and programmes to reduce access to alcohol, illegal drugs and guns.",terrorism
" Also, given significant neighbourhood effects on youth violence, interventions involving relocating families to less poor environments have shown promising results.",terrorism
" Similarly, urban renewal projects such as business improvement districts have shown a reduction in youth violence.",terrorism
"Different types of youth on youth violence include witnessing or being involved in physical, emotional and sexual abuse (e.",terrorism
" physical attacks, bullying, rape), and violent acts like gang shootings and robberies.",terrorism
" According to researchers in 2018, ""More than half of children and adolescents living in cities have experienced some form of community violence.",terrorism
""" The violence ""can also all take place under one roof, or in a given community or neighborhood and can happen at the same time or at different stages of life.",terrorism
""" Youth violence has immediate and long term adverse impact whether the individual was the recipient of the violence or a witness to it.",terrorism
"Youth violence impacts individuals, their families, and society.",terrorism
" Victims can have lifelong injuries which means ongoing doctor and hospital visits, the cost of which quickly add up.",terrorism
" Since the victims of youth-on-youth violence may not be able to attend school or work because of their physical and/or mental injuries, it is often up to their family members to take care of them, including paying their daily living expenses and medical bills.",terrorism
 Their caretakers may have to give up their jobs or work reduced hours to provide help to the victim of violence.,terrorism
 This causes a further burden on society because the victim and maybe even their caretakers have to obtain government assistance to help pay their bills.,terrorism
 Recent research has found that psychological trauma during childhood can change a child's brain.,terrorism
" ""Trauma is known to physically affect the brain and the body which causes anxiety, rage, and the ability to concentrate.",terrorism
" They can also have problems remembering, trusting, and forming relationships.",terrorism
""" Since the brain becomes used to violence it may stay continually in an alert state (similar to being stuck in the fight or flight mode).",terrorism
" ""Researchers claim that the youth who are exposed to violence may have emotional, social, and cognitive problems.",terrorism
" They may have trouble controlling emotions, paying attention in school, withdraw from friends, or show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder"".",terrorism
It is important for youth exposed to violence to understand how their bodies may react so they can take positive steps to counteract any possible short- and long-term negative effects (e.,terrorism
", poor concentration, feelings of depression, heightened levels of anxiety).",terrorism
" By taking immediate steps to mitigate the effects of the trauma they've experienced, negative repercussions can be reduced or eliminated.",terrorism
" As an initial step, the youths need to understand why they may be feeling a certain way and to understand how the violence they have experienced may be causing negative feelings and making them behave differently.",terrorism
" Pursuing a greater awareness of their feelings, perceptions, and negative emotions is the first step that should be taken as part of recovering from the trauma they have experienced.",terrorism
 “Neuroscience research shows that the only way we can change the way we feel is by becoming aware of our inner experience and learning to befriend what is going on inside ourselves”.,terrorism
"Some of the ways to combat the adverse effects of exposure to youth violence would be to try various mindfulness and movement activities, deep breathing exercises and other actions that enable youths to release their pent up emotions.",terrorism
" Using these techniques will teach body awareness, reduce anxiety and nervousness, and reduce feelings of anger and annoyance.",terrorism
 Over time these types of activities will help these younger victims of violence to have greater control over their feelings and behaviors and avoid unhealthy ways of coping.,terrorism
 Another way to help trauma victims of youth violence is through the arts.,terrorism
" This can be accomplished by giving them the opportunity to engage in drawing, painting, music, and singing which will give them an outlet to express themselves and their emotions in a positive way.",terrorism
Youth who have experienced violence benefit from having a close relationship with one or more people.,terrorism
 This is important because the trauma victims need to have people who are safe and trustworthy that they can relate and talk to about their horrible experiences.,terrorism
 Some youth do not have adult figures at home or someone they can count on for guidance and comfort.,terrorism
 Schools in bad neighborhoods where youth violence is prevalent should assign counselors to each student so that they receive regular guidance.,terrorism
" In addition to counseling/therapy sessions and programs, it has been recommended that schools offer mentoring programs where students can interact with adults who can be a positive influence on them.",terrorism
 Another way is to create more neighborhood programs to ensure that each child has a positive and stable place to go when school in not in session.,terrorism
 Many children have benefited from formal organizations now which aim to help mentor and provide a safe environment for the youth especially those living in neighborhoods with higher rates of violence.,terrorism
" This includes organizations such as Becoming a Man, CeaseFire Illinois, Chicago Area Project, Little Black Pearl, and Rainbow House"".",terrorism
" These programs are designed to help give the youth a safe place to go, stop the violence from occurring, offering counseling and mentoring to help stop the cycle of violence.",terrorism
" If the youth do not have a safe place to go after school hours they will likely get into trouble, receive poor grades, drop out of school and use drugs and alcohol.",terrorism
 The gangs look for youth who do not have positive influences in their life and need protection.,terrorism
 This is why these programs are so important for the youth to have a safe environment rather than resorting to the streets.,terrorism
"Intimate partner violence refers to behaviour in an intimate relationship that causes physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behaviours.",terrorism
Population-level surveys based on reports from victims provide the most accurate estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner violence and sexual violence in non-conflict settings.,terrorism
" A study conducted by WHO in 10 mainly developing countries found that, among women aged 15 to 49 years, between 15% (Japan) and 70% (Ethiopia and Peru) of women reported physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner.",terrorism
"Intimate partner and sexual violence have serious short- and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for victims and for their children, and lead to high social and economic costs.",terrorism
" These include both fatal and non-fatal injuries, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, unintended pregnancies, sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.",terrorism
"Factors associated with the perpetration and experiencing of intimate partner violence are low levels of education, history of violence as a perpetrator, a victim or a witness of parental violence, harmful use of alcohol, attitudes that are accepting of violence as well as marital discord and dissatisfaction.",terrorism
" Factors associated only with perpetration of intimate partner violence are having multiple partners, and antisocial personality disorder.",terrorism
"A recent theory named ""The Criminal Spin"" suggests a mutual flywheel effect between partners that is manifested by an escalation in the violence.",terrorism
" A violent spin may occur in any other forms of violence, but in Intimate partner violence the added value is the mutual spin, based on the unique situation and characteristics of intimate relationship.",terrorism
The primary prevention strategy with the best evidence for effectiveness for intimate partner violence is school-based programming for adolescents to prevent violence within dating relationships.,terrorism
" Evidence is emerging for the effectiveness of several other primary prevention strategies—those that: combine microfinance with gender equality training; promote communication and relationship skills within communities; reduce access to, and the harmful use of alcohol; and change cultural gender norms.",terrorism
"Sexual violence is any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed against a person's sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim, in any setting.",terrorism
" It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object.",terrorism
Population-level surveys based on reports from victims estimate that between 0.,terrorism
" Sexual violence has serious short- and long-term consequences on physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health for victims and for their children as described in the section on intimate partner violence.",terrorism
" If perpetrated during childhood, sexual violence can lead to increased smoking, drug and alcohol misuse, and risky sexual behaviors in later life.",terrorism
 It is also associated with perpetration of violence and being a victim of violence.,terrorism
Many of the risk factors for sexual violence are the same as for domestic violence.,terrorism
" Risk factors specific to sexual violence perpetration include beliefs in family honor and sexual purity, ideologies of male sexual entitlement and weak legal sanctions for sexual violence.",terrorism
Few interventions to prevent sexual violence have been demonstrated to be effective.,terrorism
" School-based programmes to prevent child sexual abuse by teaching children to recognize and avoid potentially sexually abusive situations are run in many parts of the world and appear promising, but require further research.",terrorism
" To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact legislation and develop policies that protect women; address discrimination against women and promote gender equality; and help to move the culture away from violence.",terrorism
"Elder maltreatment is a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person.",terrorism
" This type of violence constitutes a violation of human rights and includes physical, sexual, psychological, emotional; financial and material abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious loss of dignity and respect.",terrorism
"While there is little information regarding the extent of maltreatment in elderly populations, especially in developing countries, it is estimated that 4–6% of elderly people in high-income countries have experienced some form of maltreatment at home However, older people are often afraid to report cases of maltreatment to family, friends, or to the authorities.",terrorism
" Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce.",terrorism
 Elder maltreatment can lead to serious physical injuries and long-term psychological consequences.,terrorism
 Elder maltreatment is predicted to increase as many countries are experiencing rapidly ageing populations.,terrorism
"Many strategies have been implemented to prevent elder maltreatment and to take action against it and mitigate its consequences including public and professional awareness campaigns, screening (of potential victims and abusers), caregiver support interventions (e.",terrorism

" Their effectiveness has, however, not so far been well-established.",terrorism
"Several rare but painful episodes of assassination, attempted assassination and school shootings at elementary, middle, high schools, as well as colleges and universities in the United States, led to a considerable body of research on ascertainable behaviors of persons who have planned or carried out such attacks.",terrorism
" These studies (1995–2002) investigated what the authors called ""targeted violence,"" described the ""path to violence"" of those who planned or carried out attacks and laid out suggestions for law enforcement and educators.",terrorism

Some philosophers have argued that any interpretation of reality is intrinsically violent.,terrorism
" Slavoj Žižek in his book Violence stated that ""something violent is the very symbolization of a thing.",terrorism
""" This harm inflicted by the very interpretation of the world is known as ontological violence.",terrorism
  Ontological violence is distinct from physical violence in that it is possible to avoid physical violence whereas some ontological is intrinsic to all knowledge.,terrorism
Both Foucault and Arendt considered the relationship between power and violence but concluded that while related they are distinct.,terrorism
"In feminist philosophy, epistemic violence is the act of causing harm by an inability to understand the conversation of others due to ignorance.",terrorism
 Some philosophers think this will harm marginalized groups.,terrorism
Violence cannot be attributed to solely protective factors or risk factors.,terrorism
" Both of these factor groups are equally important in the prevention, intervention, and treatment of violence as a whole.",terrorism
" The CDC outlines several risk and protective factors for youth violence at the individual, family, social and community levels.",terrorism
"Individual risk factors include poor behavioral control, high emotional stress, low IQ, and antisocial beliefs or attitudes.",terrorism
" Family risk factors include authoritarian childrearing attitudes, inconsistent disciplinary practices, low emotional attachment to parents or caregivers, and low parental income and involvement.",terrorism
" Social risk factors include social rejection, poor academic performance and commitment to school, and gang involvement or association with delinquent peers.",terrorism
" Community risk factors include poverty, low community participation, and diminished economic opportunities.",terrorism
"On the other hand, individual protective factors include an intolerance towards deviance, higher IQ and GPA, elevated popularity and social skills, as well as religious beliefs.",terrorism
" Family protective factors include a connectedness and ability to discuss issues with family members or adults, parent/family use of constructive coping strategies, and consistent parental presence during at least one of the following: when awakening, when arriving home from school, at dinner time, or when going to bed.",terrorism
" Social protective factors include quality school relationships, close relationships with non-deviant peers, involvement in prosocial activities, and exposure to school climates that are: well supervised, use clear behavior rules and disciplinary approaches, and engage parents with teachers.",terrorism
"With many conceptual factors that occur at varying levels in the lives of those impacted, the exact causes of violence are complex.",terrorism
" To represent this complexity, the ecological, or social ecological model is often used.",terrorism
" The following four-level version of the ecological model is often used in the study of violence:
",terrorism
"The first level identifies biological and personal factors that influence how individuals behave and increase their likelihood of becoming a victim or perpetrator of violence: demographic characteristics (age, education, income), genetics, brain lesions, personality disorders, substance abuse, and a history of experiencing, witnessing, or engaging in violent behaviour.",terrorism
"The second level focuses on close relationships, such as those with family and friends.",terrorism
" In youth violence, for example, having friends who engage in or encourage violence can increase a young person's risk of being a victim or perpetrator of violence.",terrorism
" For intimate partner violence, a consistent marker at this level of the model is marital conflict or discord in the relationship.",terrorism
" In elder abuse, important factors are stress due to the nature of the past relationship between the abused person and the care giver.",terrorism
" Risk at this level may be affected by factors such as the existence of a local drug trade, the absence of social networks, and concentrated poverty.",terrorism
 All these factors have been shown to be important in several types of violence.,terrorism
"Finally, the fourth level looks at the broad societal factors that help to create a climate in which violence is encouraged or inhibited: the responsiveness of the criminal justice system, social and cultural norms regarding gender roles or parent-child relationships, income inequality, the strength of the social welfare system, the social acceptability of violence, the availability of weapons, the exposure to violence in mass media, and political instability.",terrorism
"While studies showing associations between physical punishment of children and later aggression cannot prove that physical punishment causes an increase in aggression, a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors.",terrorism
 Cross-cultural studies have shown that greater prevalence of corporal punishment of children tends to predict higher levels of violence in societies.,terrorism
" For instance, a 2005 analysis of 186 pre-industrial societies found that corporal punishment was more prevalent in societies which also had higher rates of homicide, assault, and war.",terrorism
" In the United States, domestic corporal punishment has been linked to later violent acts against family members and spouses.",terrorism
" Straus believes that disciplinary spanking forms ""the most prevalent and important form of violence in American families"", whose effects contribute to several major societal problems, including later domestic violence and crime.",terrorism
The causes of violent behavior in people are often a topic of research in psychology.,terrorism
" Neurobiologist Jan Vodka emphasizes that, for those purposes, ""violent behavior is defined as overt and intentional physically aggressive behavior against another person.",terrorism
"""Based on the idea of human nature, scientists do agree violence is inherent in humans.",terrorism
" Among prehistoric humans, there is archaeological evidence for both contentions of violence and peacefulness as primary characteristics.",terrorism
"Since violence is a matter of perception as well as a measurable phenomenon, psychologists have found variability in whether people perceive certain physical acts as ""violent"".",terrorism
" For example, in a state where execution is a legalized punishment we do not typically perceive the executioner as ""violent"", though we may talk, in a more metaphorical way, of the state acting violently.",terrorism
" Likewise, understandings of violence are linked to a perceived aggressor-victim relationship: hence psychologists have shown that people may not recognise defensive use of force as violent, even in cases where the amount of force used is significantly greater than in the original aggression.",terrorism
"The concept of violence normalization, is known as socially sanctioned or structural violence, and is a topic of increasing interest to researchers trying to understand violent behavior.",terrorism
" It has been discussed at length by researchers in sociology, medical anthropology, psychology, psychiatry, philosophy, and bioarchaeology.",terrorism
"Evolutionary psychology offers several explanations for human violence in various contexts, such as sexual jealousy in humans, child abuse, and homicide.",terrorism
 Goetz (2010) argues that humans are similar to most mammal species and use violence in specific situations.,terrorism
" He writes that ""Buss and Shackelford (1997a) proposed seven adaptive problems our ancestors recurrently faced that might have been solved by aggression: co-opting the resources of others, defending against attack, inflicting costs on same-sex rivals, negotiating status and hierarchies, deterring rivals from future aggression, deterring mate from infidelity, and reducing resources expended on genetically unrelated children.",terrorism
"""Goetz writes that most homicides seem to start from relatively trivial disputes between unrelated men who then escalate to violence and death.",terrorism
 He argues that such conflicts occur when there is a status dispute between men of relatively similar status.,terrorism
" If there is a great initial status difference, then the lower status individual usually offers no challenge and if challenged the higher status individual usually ignores the lower status individual.",terrorism
 At the same an environment of great inequalities between people may cause those at the bottom to use more violence in attempts to gain status.,terrorism
Research into the media and violence examines whether links between consuming media violence and subsequent aggressive and violent behaviour exists.,terrorism
" Although some scholars had claimed media violence may increase aggression, this view is coming increasingly in doubt both in the scholarly community and was rejected by the US Supreme Court in the Brown v EMA case, as well as in a review of video game violence by the Australian Government (2010) which concluded evidence for harmful effects were inconclusive at best and the rhetoric of some scholars was not matched by good data.",terrorism
The threat and enforcement of physical punishment has been a tried and tested method of preventing some violence since civilisation began.,terrorism
"Cities and counties throughout the United States organize “Violence Prevention Months” where the mayor, by proclamation, or the county, by a resolution, encourage the private, community and public sectors to engage in activities that raise awareness that violence is not acceptable through art, music, lectures and events.",terrorism
" For example, Violence Prevention Month coordinator, Karen Earle Lile in Contra Costa County, California created a Wall of Life, where children drew pictures that were put up in the walls of banks and public spaces, displaying a child’s view of violence they had witnessed and how it affected them, in an effort to draw attention to how violence affects the community, not just the people involved.",terrorism
A review of scientific literature by the World Health Organization on the effectiveness of strategies to prevent interpersonal violence identified the seven strategies below as being supported by either strong or emerging evidence for effectiveness.,terrorism
 These strategies target risk factors at all four levels of the ecological model.,terrorism
Among the most effective such programmes to prevent child maltreatment and reduce childhood aggression are the Nurse Family Partnership home-visiting programme and the Triple P (Parenting Program).,terrorism
" There is also emerging evidence that these programmes reduce convictions and violent acts in adolescence and early adulthood, and probably help decrease intimate partner violence and self-directed violence in later life.",terrorism
"Evidence shows that the life skills acquired in social development programmes can reduce involvement in violence, improve social skills, boost educational achievement and improve job prospects.",terrorism
" Life skills refer to social, emotional, and behavioural competencies which help children and adolescents effectively deal with the challenges of everyday life.",terrorism
Evaluation studies are beginning to support community interventions that aim to prevent violence against women by promoting gender equality.,terrorism
" For instance, evidence suggests that programmes that combine microfinance with gender equity training can reduce intimate partner violence.",terrorism
 School-based programmes such as Safe Dates programme in the United States of America and the Youth Relationship Project in Canada have been found to be effective for reducing dating violence.,terrorism
Rules or expectations of behaviour – norms – within a cultural or social group can encourage violence.,terrorism
" Interventions that challenge cultural and social norms supportive of violence can prevent acts of violence and have been widely used, but the evidence base for their effectiveness is currently weak.",terrorism
 The effectiveness of interventions addressing dating violence and sexual abuse among teenagers and young adults by challenging social and cultural norms related to gender is supported by some evidence.,terrorism
Interventions to identify victims of interpersonal violence and provide effective care and support are critical for protecting health and breaking cycles of violence from one generation to the next.,terrorism
" Examples for which evidence of effectiveness is emerging includes: screening tools to identify victims of intimate partner violence and refer them to appropriate services; psychosocial interventions—such as trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy—to reduce mental health problems associated with violence, including post-traumatic stress disorder; and protection orders, which prohibit a perpetrator from contacting the victim, to reduce repeat victimization among victims of intimate partner violence.",terrorism
"Not surprisingly, scientific evidence about the effectiveness of interventions to prevent collective violence is lacking.",terrorism
" However, policies that facilitate reductions in poverty, that make decision-making more accountable, that reduce inequalities between groups, as well as policies that reduce access to biological, chemical, nuclear and other weapons have been recommended.",terrorism
" When planning responses to violent conflicts, recommended approaches include assessing at an early stage who is most vulnerable and what their needs are, co-ordination of activities between various players and working towards global, national and local capabilities so as to deliver effective health services during the various stages of an emergency.",terrorism
 Sociologist Max Weber stated that the state claims the monopoly of the legitimate use of force practised within the confines of a specific territory.,terrorism
 Law enforcement is the main means of regulating nonmilitary violence in society.,terrorism
" Governments regulate the use of violence through legal systems governing individuals and political authorities, including the police and military.",terrorism
" Civil societies authorize some amount of violence, exercised through the police power, to maintain the status quo and enforce laws.",terrorism
"However, German political theorist Hannah Arendt noted: ""Violence can be justifiable, but it never will be legitimate .",terrorism
 Its justification loses in plausibility the farther its intended end recedes into the future.,terrorism
" No one questions the use of violence in self-defence, because the danger is not only clear but also present, and the end justifying the means is immediate"".",terrorism
 Arendt made a clear distinction between violence and power.,terrorism
 Most political theorists regarded violence as an extreme manifestation of power whereas Arendt regarded the two concepts as opposites.,terrorism
"In the 20th century in acts of democide governments may have killed more than 260 million of their own people through police brutality, execution, massacre, slave labour camps, and sometimes through intentional famine.",terrorism
"Violent acts that are not carried out by the military or police and that are not in self-defense are usually classified as crimes, although not all crimes are violent crimes.",terrorism
 Damage to property is classified as violent crime in some jurisdictions but not in all.,terrorism
 The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) classifies violence resulting in homicide into criminal homicide and justifiable homicide (e.,terrorism
"The criminal justice approach sees its main task as enforcing laws that proscribe violence and ensuring that ""justice is done"".",terrorism
" The notions of individual blame, responsibility, guilt, and culpability are central to criminal justice's approach to violence and one of the criminal justice system's main tasks is to ""do justice"", i.",terrorism
" to ensure that offenders are properly identified, that the degree of their guilt is as accurately ascertained as possible, and that they are punished appropriately.",terrorism
" To prevent and respond to violence, the criminal justice approach relies primarily on deterrence, incarceration and the punishment and rehabilitation of perpetrators.",terrorism
"The criminal justice approach, beyond justice and punishment, has traditionally emphasized indicated interventions, aimed at those who have already been involved in violence, either as victims or as perpetrators.",terrorism
" One of the main reasons offenders are arrested, prosecuted, and convicted is to prevent further crimes—through deterrence (threatening potential offenders with criminal sanctions if they commit crimes), incapacitation (physically preventing offenders from committing further crimes by locking them up) and through rehabilitation (using time spent under state supervision to develop skills or change one's psychological make-up to reduce the likelihood of future offences).",terrorism
"In recent decades in many countries in the world, the criminal justice system has taken an increasing interest in preventing violence before it occurs.",terrorism
" For instance, much of community and problem-oriented policing aims to reduce crime and violence by altering the conditions that foster it—and not to increase the number of arrests.",terrorism
" Indeed, some police leaders have gone so far as to say the police should primarily be a crime prevention agency.",terrorism
 Juvenile justice systems—an important component of criminal justice systems—are largely based on the belief in rehabilitation and prevention.,terrorism
" In the US, the criminal justice system has, for instance, funded school- and community-based initiatives to reduce children's access to guns and teach conflict resolution.",terrorism
" Despite this, force is used routinely against juveniles by police.",terrorism
" In 1974, the US Department of Justice assumed primary responsibility for delinquency prevention programmes and created the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which has supported the ""Blueprints for violence prevention"" programme at the University of Colorado Boulder.",terrorism
"The public health approach is a science-driven, population-based, interdisciplinary, intersectoral approach based on the ecological model which emphasizes primary prevention.",terrorism
" Rather than focusing on individuals, the public health approach aims to provide the maximum benefit for the largest number of people, and to extend better care and safety to entire populations.",terrorism
" The public health approach is interdisciplinary, drawing upon knowledge from many disciplines including medicine, epidemiology, sociology, psychology, criminology, education and economics.",terrorism
" Because all forms of violence are multi-faceted problems, the public health approach emphasizes a multi-sectoral response.",terrorism
" It has been proved time and again that cooperative efforts from such diverse sectors as health, education, social welfare, and criminal justice are often necessary to solve what are usually assumed to be purely ""criminal"" or ""medical"" problems.",terrorism
" The public health approach considers that violence, rather than being the result of any single factor, is the outcome of multiple risk factors and causes, interacting at four levels of a nested hierarchy (individual, close relationship/family, community and wider society) of the Social ecological model.",terrorism
"From a public health perspective, prevention strategies can be classified into three types:
",terrorism
Primary prevention – approaches that aim to prevent violence before it occurs.,terrorism
"Secondary prevention – approaches that focus on the more immediate responses to violence, such as pre-hospital care, emergency services or treatment for sexually transmitted infections following a rape.",terrorism
"Tertiary prevention – approaches that focus on long-term care in the wake of violence, such as rehabilitation and reintegration, and attempt to lessen trauma or reduce long-term disability associated with violence.",terrorism
"A public health approach emphasizes the primary prevention of violence, i.",terrorism
" Until recently, this approach has been relatively neglected in the field, with the majority of resources directed towards secondary or tertiary prevention.",terrorism
" Perhaps the most critical element of a public health approach to prevention is the ability to identify underlying causes rather than focusing upon more visible ""symptoms"".",terrorism
 This allows for the development and testing of effective approaches to address the underlying causes and so improve health.,terrorism
"The public health approach is an evidence-based and systematic process involving the following four steps:
",terrorism
"Defining the problem conceptually and numerically, using statistics that accurately describe the nature and scale of violence, the characteristics of those most affected, the geographical distribution of incidents, and the consequences of exposure to such violence.",terrorism
"Investigating why the problem occurs by determining its causes and correlates, the factors that increase or decrease the risk of its occurrence (risk and protective factors) and the factors that might be modifiable through intervention.",terrorism
"Exploring ways to prevent the problem by using the above information and designing, monitoring and rigorously assessing the effectiveness of programmes through outcome evaluations.",terrorism
Disseminating information on the effectiveness of programmes and increasing the scale of proven effective programmes.,terrorism
" Approaches to prevent violence, whether targeted at individuals or entire communities, must be properly evaluated for their effectiveness and the results shared.",terrorism
 This step also includes adapting programmes to local contexts and subjecting them to rigorous re-evaluation to ensure their effectiveness in the new setting.,terrorism
"In many countries, violence prevention is still a new or emerging field in public health.",terrorism
 The public health community has started only recently to realize the contributions it can make to reducing violence and mitigating its consequences.,terrorism
" In 1949, Gordon called for injury prevention efforts to be based on the understanding of causes, in a similar way to prevention efforts for communicable and other diseases.",terrorism
" In 1962, Gomez, referring to the WHO definition of health, stated that it is obvious that violence does not contribute to ""extending life"" or to a ""complete state of well-being"".",terrorism
" He defined violence as an issue that public health experts needed to address and stated that it should not be the primary domain of lawyers, military personnel, or politicians.",terrorism
"However, it is only in the last 30 years that public health has begun to address violence, and only in the last fifteen has it done so at the global level.",terrorism
 This is a much shorter period of time than public health has been tackling other health problems of comparable magnitude and with similarly severe lifelong consequences.,terrorism
The global public health response to interpersonal violence began in earnest in the mid-1990s.,terrorism
" In 1996, the World Health Assembly adopted Resolution WHA49.",terrorism
"25 which declared violence ""a leading worldwide public health problem"" and requested that the World Health Organization (WHO) initiate public health activities to (1) document and characterize the burden of violence, (2) assess the effectiveness of programmes, with particular attention to women and children and community-based initiatives, and (3) promote activities to tackle the problem at the international and national levels.",terrorism
 The World Health Organization's initial response to this resolution was to create the Department of Violence and Injury Prevention and Disability and to publish the World report on violence and health (2002).,terrorism
The case for the public health sector addressing interpersonal violence rests on four main arguments.,terrorism
" First, the significant amount of time health care professionals dedicate to caring for victims and perpetrators of violence has made them familiar with the problem and has led many, particularly in emergency departments, to mobilize to address it.",terrorism
" The information, resources, and infrastructures the health care sector has at its disposal are an important asset for research and prevention work.",terrorism
" Second, the magnitude of the problem and its potentially severe lifelong consequences and high costs to individuals and wider society call for population-level interventions typical of the public health approach.",terrorism
" Third, the criminal justice approach, the other main approach to addressing violence (link to entry above), has traditionally been more geared towards violence that occurs between male youths and adults in the street and other public places—which makes up the bulk of homicides in most countries—than towards violence occurring in private settings such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence and elder abuse—which makes up the largest share of non-fatal violence.",terrorism
" Fourth, evidence is beginning to accumulate that a science-based public health approach is effective at preventing interpersonal violence.",terrorism
"The human rights approach is based on the obligations of states to respect, protect and fulfill human rights and therefore to prevent, eradicate and punish violence.",terrorism
" It recognizes violence as a violation of many human rights: the rights to life, liberty, autonomy and security of the person; the rights to equality and non-discrimination; the rights to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment; the right to privacy; and the right to the highest attainable standard of health.",terrorism
" These human rights are enshrined in international and regional treaties and national constitutions and laws, which stipulate the obligations of states, and include mechanisms to hold states accountable.",terrorism
" The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, for example, requires that countries party to the Convention take all appropriate steps to end violence against women.",terrorism
" The Convention on the Rights of the Child in its Article 19 states that States Parties shall take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.",terrorism
"Violence, as defined in the dictionary of human geography, ""appears whenever power is in jeopardy"" and ""in and of itself stands emptied of strength and purpose: it is part of a larger matrix of socio-political power struggles"".",terrorism
" Violence can be broadly divided into three broad categories—direct violence, structural violence and cultural violence.",terrorism
" Thus defined and delineated, it is of note, as Hyndman says, that ""geography came late to theorizing violence"" in comparison to other social sciences.",terrorism
" Social and human geography, rooted in the humanist, Marxist, and feminist subfields that emerged following the early positivist approaches and subsequent behavioral turn, have long been concerned with social and spatial justice.",terrorism
"Along with critical geographers and political geographers, it is these groupings of geographers that most often interact with violence.",terrorism
" Keeping this idea of social/spatial justice via geography in mind, it is worthwhile to look at geographical approaches to violence in the context of politics.",terrorism
"Derek Gregory and Alan Pred assembled the influential edited collection Violent Geographies: Fear, Terror, and Political Violence, which demonstrates how place, space, and landscape are foremost factors in the real and imagined practices of organized violence both historically and in the present.",terrorism
" Evidently, political violence often gives a part for the state to play.",terrorism
" When ""modern states not only claim a monopoly of the legitimate means of violence; they also routinely use the threat of violence to enforce the rule of law"", the law not only becomes a form of violence but is violence.",terrorism
 Philosopher Giorgio Agamben's concepts of state of exception and homo sacer are useful to consider within a geography of violence.,terrorism
" The state, in the grip of a perceived, potential crisis (whether legitimate or not) takes preventative legal measures, such as a suspension of rights (it is in this climate, as Agamben demonstrates, that the formation of the Social Democratic and Nazi government's lager or concentration camp can occur).",terrorism
" However, when this ""in limbo"" reality is designed to be in place ""until further notice…the state of exception thus ceases to be referred to as an external and provisional state of factual danger and comes to be confused with juridical rule itself"".",terrorism
" For Agamben, the physical space of the camp ""is a piece of land placed outside the normal juridical order, but it is nevertheless not simply an external space"".",terrorism
" At the scale of the body, in the state of exception, a person is so removed from their rights by ""juridical procedures and deployments of power"" that ""no act committed against them could appear any longer as a crime""; in other words, people become only homo sacer.",terrorism
" Guantanamo Bay could also be said to represent the physicality of the state of exception in space, and can just as easily draw man as homo sacer.",terrorism
"In the 1970s, genocides in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot resulted in the deaths of over two million Cambodians (which was 25% of the Cambodian population), forming one of the many contemporary examples of state-sponsored violence.",terrorism
" About fourteen thousand of these murders occurred at Choeung Ek, which is the best-known of the extermination camps referred to as the Killing Fields.",terrorism
" The killings were arbitrary; for example, a person could be killed for wearing glasses, since that was seen as associating them with intellectuals and therefore as making them part of the enemy.",terrorism
 People were murdered with impunity because it was no crime; Cambodians were made homo sacer in a condition of bare life.,terrorism
 The Killing Fields—manifestations of Agamben's concept of camps beyond the normal rule of law—featured the state of exception.,terrorism
" As part of Pol Pot's ""ideological intent…to create a purely agrarian society or cooperative"", he ""dismantled the country's existing economic infrastructure and depopulated every urban area"".",terrorism
" Forced movement, such as this forced movement applied by Pol Pot, is a clear display of structural violence.",terrorism
" When ""symbols of Cambodian society were equally disrupted, social institutions of every kind…were purged or torn down"", cultural violence (defined as when ""any aspect of culture such as language, religion, ideology, art, or cosmology is used to legitimize direct or structural violence"") is added to the structural violence of forced movement and to the direct violence, such as murder, at the Killing Fields.",terrorism
 Vietnam eventually intervened and the genocide officially ended.,terrorism
" However, ten million landmines left by opposing guerillas in the 1970s continue to create a violent landscape in Cambodia.",terrorism
"Human geography, though coming late to the theorizing table, has tackled violence through many lenses, including anarchist geography, feminist geography, Marxist geography, political geography, and critical geography.",terrorism
" However, Adriana Cavarero notes that, ""as violence spreads and assumes unheard-of forms, it becomes difficult to name in contemporary language"".",terrorism
" Cavarero proposes that, in facing such a truth, it is prudent to reconsider violence as ""horrorism""; that is, ""as though ideally all the…victims, instead of their killers, ought to determine the name"".",terrorism
" With geography often adding the forgotten spatial aspect to theories of social science, rather than creating them solely within the discipline, it seems that the self-reflexive contemporary geography of today may have an extremely important place in this current (re)imaging of violence, exemplified by Cavarero.",terrorism
" Suicide accounts for about 883,000, interpersonal violence for 456,000 and collective violence for 18,000.",terrorism
" Deaths due to collective violence have decreased from 64,000 in 1990.",terrorism
5 millions deaths a year due to violence is greater than the number of deaths due to tuberculosis (1.,terrorism
"21 million), and malaria (830'000), but slightly less than the number of people who die from HIV/AIDS (1.",terrorism
"For every death due to violence, there are numerous nonfatal injuries.",terrorism
" In 2008, over 16 million cases of non-fatal violence-related injuries were severe enough to require medical attention.",terrorism
" Beyond deaths and injuries, forms of violence such as child maltreatment, intimate partner violence, and elder maltreatment have been found to be highly prevalent.",terrorism
"In the last 45 years, suicide rates have increased by 60% worldwide.",terrorism
" Suicide is among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15–44 years in some countries, and the second leading cause of death in the 10–24 years age group.",terrorism
 These figures do not include suicide attempts which are up to 20 times more frequent than completed suicide.,terrorism
 Suicide was the 16th leading cause of death worldwide in 2004 and is projected to increase to the 12th in 2030.,terrorism
" Although suicide rates have traditionally been highest among the male elderly, rates among young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now the group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and developing countries.",terrorism
Rates and patterns of violent death vary by country and region.,terrorism
" In recent years, homicide rates have been highest in developing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean and lowest in East Asia, the western Pacific, and some countries in northern Africa.",terrorism
" Studies show a strong, inverse relationship between homicide rates and both economic development and economic equality.",terrorism
" Poorer countries, especially those with large gaps between the rich and the poor, tend to have higher rates of homicide than wealthier countries.",terrorism
" For the 15 to 29 age group, male rates were nearly six times those for female rates; for the remaining age groups, male rates were from two to four times those for females.",terrorism
"Studies in a number of countries show that, for every homicide among young people age 10 to 24, 20 to 40 other young people receive hospital treatment for a violent injury.",terrorism
Forms of violence such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence are highly prevalent.,terrorism
" Approximately 20% of women and 5–10% of men report being sexually abused as children, while 25–50% of all children report being physically abused.",terrorism
 A WHO multi-country study found that between 15–71% of women reported experiencing physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner at some point in their lives.,terrorism
"Wars grab headlines, but the individual risk of dying violently in an armed conflict is today relatively low—much lower than the risk of violent death in many countries that are not suffering from an armed conflict.",terrorism
" For example, between 1976 and 2008, African Americans were victims of 329,825 homicides.",terrorism
" Although there is a widespread perception that war is the most dangerous form of armed violence in the world, the average person living in a conflict-affected country had a risk of dying violently in the conflict of about 2.",terrorism
 This can be compared to the average world homicide rate of 7.,terrorism
 This illustration highlights the value of accounting for all forms of armed violence rather than an exclusive focus on conflict related violence.,terrorism
" Certainly, there are huge variations in the risk of dying from armed conflict at the national and subnational level, and the risk of dying violently in a conflict in specific countries remains extremely high.",terrorism
" In Iraq, for example, the direct conflict death rate for 2004–07 was 65 per 100,000 people per year and, in Somalia, 24 per 100,000 people.",terrorism
" This rate even reached peaks of 91 per 100,000 in Iraq in 2006 and 74 per 100,000 in Somalia in 2007.",terrorism
"Scientific evidence for warfare has come from settled, sedentary communities.",terrorism
" Some scholars argue humans may have a predisposition for violence (chimpanzees, also great apes, have been known to kill members of competing groups for resources like food), placing the origins of organized violence prior to modern settled societies.",terrorism
" However, actual evidence suggests that organized, large-scale, militaristic, or regular human-on-human violence was absent for the vast majority of the human timeline, and is first documented to have started only relatively recently in the Holocene, an epoch that began about 11,700 years ago, probably with the advent of higher population densities due to sedentism.",terrorism
" Fry writes that scholars are divided on the origins of this greater degree of violence—in other words, war-like behavior: There are basically two schools of thought on this issue.",terrorism
 goes back at least to the time of the first thoroughly modern humans and even before then to the primate ancestors of the hominid lineage.,terrorism
 The second positions on the origins of warfare sees war as much less common in the cultural and biological evolution of humans.,terrorism
" Here, warfare is a latecomer on the cultural horizon, only arising in very specific material circumstances and being quite rare in human history until the development of agriculture in the past 10,000 years.",terrorism
"Jared Diamond in his books Guns, Germs and Steel and The Third Chimpanzee posits that the rise of large-scale warfare is the result of advances in technology and city-states.",terrorism
" For instance, the rise of agriculture provided a significant increase in the number of individuals that a region could sustain over hunter-gatherer societies, allowing for development of specialized classes such as soldiers, or weapons manufacturers.",terrorism
"In academia, the idea of the peaceful pre-history and non-violent tribal societies gained popularity with the post-colonial perspective.",terrorism
" The trend, starting in archaeology and spreading to anthropology reached its height in the late half of the 20th century.",terrorism
" However, some newer research in archaeology and bioarchaeology may provide evidence that violence within and among groups is not a recent phenomenon.",terrorism
" According to the book ""The Bioarchaeology of Violence"" violence is a behavior that is found throughout human history.",terrorism
" Keeley at the University of Illinois writes in War Before Civilization that 87% of tribal societies were at war more than once per year, and that 65% of them were fighting continuously.",terrorism
" He writes that the attrition rate of numerous close-quarter clashes, which characterize endemic warfare, produces casualty rates of up to 60%, compared to 1% of the combatants as is typical in modern warfare.",terrorism
" ""Primitive Warfare"" of these small groups or tribes was driven by the basic need for sustenance and violent competition.",terrorism
"Fry explores Keeley's argument in depth and counters that such sources erroneously focus on the ethnography of hunters and gatherers in the present, whose culture and values have been infiltrated externally by modern civilization, rather than the actual archaeological record spanning some two million years of human existence.",terrorism
" Fry determines that all present ethnographically studied tribal societies, ""by the very fact of having been described and published by anthropologists, have been irrevocably impacted by history and modern colonial nation states"" and that ""many have been affected by state societies for at least 5000 years.",terrorism
"""The relatively peaceful period since World War II is known as the Long Peace.",terrorism
"Steven Pinker's 2011 book, The Better Angels of Our Nature, argued that modern society is less violent than in periods of the past, whether on the short scale of decades or long scale of centuries or millennia.",terrorism
"Steven Pinker argues that by every possible measure, every type of violence has drastically decreased since ancient and medieval times.",terrorism
" A few centuries ago, for example, genocide was a standard practice in all kinds of warfare and was so common that historians did not even bother to mention it.",terrorism
" Cannibalism and slavery have been greatly reduced in the last thousand years, and capital punishment is now banned in many countries.",terrorism
" According to Pinker, rape, murder, warfare and animal cruelty have all seen drastic declines in the 20th century.",terrorism
" Pinker's analyses have also been criticized, concerning the statistical question of how to measure violence and whether it is in fact declining.",terrorism
"Pinker's observation of the decline in interpersonal violence echoes the work of Norbert Elias, who attributes the decline to a ""civilizing process"", in which the state's monopolization of violence, the maintenance of socioeconomic interdependencies or ""figurations"", and the maintenance of behavioural codes in culture all contribute to the development of individual sensibilities, which increase the repugnance of individuals towards violent acts.",terrorism
" According to a 2010 study, non-lethal violence, such as assaults or bullying appear to be declining as well.",terrorism
Some scholars disagree with the argument that all violence is decreasing arguing that not all types of violent behaviour are lower now than in the past.,terrorism
" They suggest that research typically focuses on lethal violence, often looks at homicide rates of death due to warfare, but ignore the less obvious forms of violence.",terrorism
"Beyond deaths and injuries, highly prevalent forms of violence (such as child maltreatment and intimate partner violence) have serious lifelong non-injury health consequences.",terrorism
" Victims may engage in high-risk behaviours such as alcohol and substance misuse and smoking, which in turn can contribute to cardiovascular disorders, cancers, depression, diabetes and HIV/AIDS, resulting in premature death.",terrorism
" The balances of prevention, mitigation, mediation and exacerbation are complex, and vary with the underpinnings of violence.",terrorism
"In countries with high levels of violence, economic growth can be slowed down, personal and collective security eroded, and social development impeded.",terrorism
 Families edging out of poverty and investing in schooling their sons and daughters can be ruined through the violent death or severe disability of the main breadwinner.,terrorism
 Communities can be caught in poverty traps where pervasive violence and deprivation form a vicious circle that stifles economic growth.,terrorism
" For societies, meeting the direct costs of health, criminal justice, and social welfare responses to violence diverts many billions of dollars from more constructive societal spending.",terrorism
" The much larger indirect costs of violence due to lost productivity and lost investment in education work together to slow economic development, increase socioeconomic inequality, and erode human and social capital.",terrorism
"Additionally, communities with high level of violence do not provide the level of stability and predictability vital for a prospering business economy.",terrorism
 Individuals will be less likely to invest money and effort towards growth in such unstable and violent conditions.,terrorism
 One of the possible proves might be the study of Baten and Gust that used “regicide” as measurement unit to approximate the influence of interpersonal violence and depict the influence of high interpersonal violence on economic development and level of investments.,terrorism
 The results of the research prove the correlation of the human capital and the interpersonal violence.,terrorism
"In 2016, the Institute for Economics and Peace, released the Economic Value of Peace report, which estimates the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy, the total economic impact of violence on the world economy in 2015 was estimated to be $13.",terrorism
Religious and political ideologies have been the cause of interpersonal violence throughout history.,terrorism
" Ideologues often falsely accuse others of violence, such as the ancient blood libel against Jews, the medieval accusations of casting witchcraft spells against women, and modern accusations of satanic ritual abuse against day care center owners and others.",terrorism
Both supporters and opponents of the 21st-century War on Terrorism regard it largely as an ideological and religious war.,terrorism
"Vittorio Bufacchi describes two different modern concepts of violence, one the ""minimalist conception"" of violence as an intentional act of excessive or destructive force, the other the ""comprehensive conception"" which includes violations of rights, including a long list of human needs.",terrorism
 They believe private property and profit survive only because police violence defends them and that capitalist economies need war to expand.,terrorism
" They may use the term ""structural violence"" to describe the systematic ways in which a given social structure or institution kills people slowly by preventing them from meeting their basic needs, for example the deaths caused by diseases because of lack of medicine.",terrorism
"Frantz Fanon critiqued the violence of colonialism and wrote about the counter violence of the ""colonized victims.",terrorism
"""Throughout history, most religions and individuals like Mahatma Gandhi have preached that humans are capable of eliminating individual violence and organizing societies through purely nonviolent means.",terrorism

" But, certainly, violence is more than killing people, unless one includes all those words and actions that kill people slowly.",terrorism
 The effect of limitation to a “killing fields” perspective is the widespread neglect of many other forms of violence.,terrorism
" We must insist that violence also refers to that which is psychologically destructive, that which demeans, damages, or depersonalizes others.",terrorism
" In view of these considerations, violence may be defined as follows: any action, verbal or nonverbal, oral or written, physical or psychical, active or passive, public or private, individual or institutional/societal, human or divine, in whatever degree of intensity, that abuses, violates, injures, or kills.",terrorism

" Top management included the shura council as well as committees on military operations, finance, and information sharing.",terrorism

"The Money/Business Committee, which funds the recruitment and training of operatives through the hawala banking system.",terrorism
" US-led efforts to eradicate the sources of ""terrorist financing"" were most successful in the year immediately following the September 11 attacks.",terrorism
" Al-Qaeda continues to operate through unregulated banks, such as the 1,000 or so hawaladars in Pakistan, some of which can handle deals of up to US$10 million.",terrorism

" Curtis contended the name ""al-Qaeda"" was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the 1998 US embassy bombings in East Africa.",terrorism
The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy.,terrorism
 These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance.,terrorism
" There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term ""al-Qaeda"" to refer to the name of a group until after September 11 attacks, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it.",terrorism

"The number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown.",terrorism
 Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden's compound in 2011 show that the core al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170.,terrorism
" In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries.",terrorism
" As of 2009, it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders.",terrorism
"According to the 2004 BBC documentary The Power of Nightmares, al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates.",terrorism
" The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.",terrorism
" Al-Qaeda's commanders, as well as its sleeping agents, are hiding in different parts of the world to this day.",terrorism
 They are mainly hunted by the American and Israeli secret services.,terrorism

 Many of these fighters went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global jihad.,terrorism
" Another group, which numbered 10,000 in 2006, live in the West and have received rudimentary combat training.",terrorism
"Other analysts have described al-Qaeda's rank and file as being ""predominantly Arab"" in its first years of operation, but that the organization also includes ""other peoples"" as of 2007.",terrorism
 It has been estimated that 62 percent of al-Qaeda members have a university education.,terrorism
" In 2011 and the following year, the Americans successfully settled accounts with Osama bin Laden, Anwar al-Awlaki, the organization's chief propagandist, and Abu Yahya al-Libi's deputy commander.",terrorism
 The optimistic voices were already saying it was over for al-Qaeda.,terrorism
" Nevertheless, it was around this time that the Arab Spring greeted the region, the turmoil of which came great to al-Qaeda's regional forces.",terrorism
" Seven years later, Ayman al-Zawahiri became arguably the number one leader in the organization, implementing his strategy with systematic consistency.",terrorism
" Tens of thousands loyal to al-Qaeda and related organizations were able to challenge local and regional stability and ruthlessly attack their enemies in the Middle East, Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Europe and Russia alike.",terrorism

 Arnaout revealed that Qatar Charity was cited by Bin Laden in 1993 as one of the charities used to channel financial support to al-Qaeda operatives overseas.,terrorism
 The same documents also report Bin Laden's complaint that the failed assassination attempt of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had compromised the ability of al-Qaeda to exploit charities to support its operatives to the extent it was capable of before 1995.,terrorism
It is alleged that the Qatar Charity gave financial support to members of al-Qaeda in Chechnya.,terrorism
 This accusation was publicly denied by Hamad bin Nasser al-Thani.,terrorism

" Abdel Bari Atwan summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the Ummah from all forms of oppression:
",terrorism
Provoke the United States and the West into invading a Muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on US soil that results in massive civilian casualties.,terrorism
Expand the conflict to neighboring countries and engage the US and its allies in a long war of attrition.,terrorism
"Convert al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against the US and countries allied with the US until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the 2004 Madrid train bombings, but which did not have the same effect with the July 7, 2005 London bombings.",terrorism
"The US economy will finally collapse by the year 2020, under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places.",terrorism
" This will lead to a collapse in the worldwide economic system, and lead to global political instability.",terrorism
" This will lead to a global jihad led by al-Qaeda, and a Wahhabi Caliphate will then be installed across the world.",terrorism
"Atwan noted that, while the plan is unrealistic, ""it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the downfall of the Soviet Union.",terrorism
"""According to Fouad Hussein, a Jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with Al-Zarqawi, Al Qaeda's strategy consists of seven phases and is similar to the plan described in Al Qaeda's Strategy to the year 2020.",terrorism
 The goal of the phase is to provoke the United States to attack a Muslim country by executing an attack that kills many civilians on US soil.,terrorism
 The goal of this phase was to recruit young men to the cause and to transform the al-Qaeda group into a movement.,terrorism
 Iraq was supposed to become the center of all operations with financial and military support for bases in other states.,terrorism
"""Arising and Standing up"", was supposed to last from 2007 to 2010.",terrorism
" In this phase, al-Qaeda wanted to execute additional attacks and focus their attention on Syria.",terrorism
 Hussein believed other countries in the Arabian Peninsula were also in danger.,terrorism
Al-Qaeda expected a steady growth among their ranks and territories due to the declining power of the regimes in the Arabian Peninsula.,terrorism
" The main focus of attack in this phase was supposed to be on oil suppliers and cyberterrorism, targeting the US economy and military infrastructure.",terrorism
"The declaration of an Islamic Caliphate, which was projected between 2013 and 2016.",terrorism
" In this phase, al-Qaeda expected the resistance from Israel to be heavily reduced.",terrorism
"The declaration of an ""Islamic Army"" and a ""fight between believers and non-believers"", also called ""total confrontation"".",terrorism
"According to the seven-phase strategy, the war is projected to last less than two years.",terrorism
"According to Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute and Katherine Zimmerman of the American Enterprise Institute, the new model of al-Qaeda is to ""socialize communities"" and build a broad territorial base of operations with the support of local communities, also gaining income independent of the funding of sheiks.",terrorism
"The English name of the organization is a simplified transliteration of the Arabic noun al-qāʿidah (‏القاعدة‎), which means ""the foundation"" or ""the base"".",terrorism
" The initial al- is the Arabic definite article ""the"", hence ""the base"".",terrorism
" However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name are not phones found in the English language, the common naturalized English pronunciations include ,  and .",terrorism
" Al-Qaeda's name can also be transliterated as al-Qaida, al-Qa'ida, or el-Qaida.",terrorism
"Bin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with Al Jazeera journalist Tayseer Alouni in October 2001:
",terrorism
The name 'al-Qaeda' was established a long time ago by mere chance.,terrorism
 The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against Russia's terrorism.,terrorism
It has been argued that two documents seized from the Sarajevo office of the Benevolence International Foundation prove the name was not simply adopted by the mujahideen movement and that a group called al-Qaeda was established in August 1988.,terrorism
" Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term ""al-Qaeda"".",terrorism
"Former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as ""the database"", because it originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.",terrorism
" In April 2002, the group assumed the name Qa'idat al-Jihad (قاعدة الجهاد qāʿidat al-jihād), which means ""the base of Jihad"".",terrorism
" According to Diaa Rashwan, this was ""apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt's al-Jihad, which was led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s.",terrorism
The radical Islamist movement developed during the Islamic revival and the rise of the Islamist movement after the Iranian Revolution (1978-1979).,terrorism
Some have argued that the writings of Islamic author and thinker Sayyid Qutb inspired the al-Qaeda organization.,terrorism
" In the 1950s and 1960s, Qutb preached that because of the lack of sharia law, the Muslim world was no longer Muslim, and had reverted to the pre-Islamic ignorance known as jahiliyyah.",terrorism
" To restore Islam, Qutb argued that a vanguard of righteous Muslims was needed in order to establish ""true Islamic states"", implement sharia, and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences.",terrorism
" In Qutb's view, the enemies of Islam included ""world Jewry"", which ""plotted conspiracies"" and opposed Islam.",terrorism
"In the words of Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, a close college friend of bin Laden: Islam is different from any other religion; it's a way of life.",terrorism
" We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk.",terrorism
" Zawahiri's uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb's student, protégé, personal lawyer, and an executor of his estate.",terrorism
 Azzam was one of the last people to see Qutb alive before his execution.,terrorism
 Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work Knights under the Prophet's Banner.,terrorism
" These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce sharia law.",terrorism
The Afghan jihad against the pro-Soviet government further developed the Salafist Jihadist movement which inspired Al-Qaeda.,terrorism
"While the leadership's own theological platform is essentially Salafi, the organization's umbrella is sufficiently wide to encompass various schools of thought and political leanings.",terrorism
" Al-Qaeda counts among its members and supporters people associated with Wahhabism, Shafi'ism, Malikism, and Hanafism.",terrorism
" There are even some Al-Qaeda members whose beliefs and practices are directly at odds with Salafism, such as Yunis Khalis, one of the leaders of the Afghan mujahedin.",terrorism
 He was a mystic who visited the tombs of saints and sought their blessings – practices inimical to bin Laden's Wahhabi-Salafi school of thought.,terrorism
" Al-Qaeda seems implacably opposed to it, as it holds Shi'ism to be heresy.",terrorism
" In Iraq it has openly declared war on the Badr Brigades, who have fully cooperated with the US, and now considers even Shi'i civilians to be legitimate targets for acts of violence.",terrorism
"Following its 9/11 attack and in response to its condemnation by Islamic scholars, Al-Qaeda provided a justification for the killing of non-combatants/civilians, entitled, ""A Statement from Qaidat al-Jihad Regarding the Mandates of the Heroes and the Legality of the Operations in New York and Washington"".",terrorism
" According to a couple of critics, Quintan Wiktorowicz and John Kaltner, it provides ""ample theological justification for killing civilians in almost any imaginable situation.",terrorism
"""Among these justifications are that America is leading the west in waging a War on Islam so that attacks on America are a defense of Islam and any treaties and agreements between Muslim majority states and Western countries that would be violated by attacks are null and void.",terrorism
" According to the tract, several conditions allow for the killing of civilians including:
",terrorism
"retaliation for the American war on Islam which al-Qaeda alleges has targeted ""Muslim women, children and elderly"";
",terrorism
"when it is too difficult to distinguish between non-combatants and combatants when attacking an enemy ""stronghold"" (hist) and/or non-combatants remain in enemy territory, killing them is allowed;
",terrorism
"those who assist the enemy ""in deed, word, mind"" are eligible for killing, and this includes the general population in democratic countries because civilians can vote in elections that bring enemies of Islam to power;
",terrorism
"the necessity of killing in the war to protect Islam and Muslims;
",terrorism
"the prophet Muhammad, when asked whether the Muslim fighters could use the catapult against the village of Taif, replied affirmatively, even though the enemy fighters were mixed with a civilian population;

"The Guardian in 2009 described five distinct phases in the development of al-Qaeda: its beginnings in the late 1980s, a ""wilderness"" period in 1990–1996, its ""heyday"" in 1996–2001, a network period from 2001 to 2005, and a period of fragmentation from 2005 to 2009.",terrorism
The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced to the Soviet War in Afghanistan (December 1979 – February 1989).,terrorism
" The United States viewed the conflict in Afghanistan in terms of the Cold War, with Marxists on one side and the native Afghan mujahideen on the other.",terrorism
" This view led to a CIA program called Operation Cyclone, which channeled funds through Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency to the Afghan Mujahideen.",terrorism
 The US government provided substantial financial support to the Afghan Islamic militants.,terrorism
" Aid to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an Afghan mujahideen leader and founder of the Hezb-e Islami, amounted to more than $600 million.",terrorism
" In addition to American aid, Hekmatyar was the recipient of Saudi aid.",terrorism
" In the early 1990s, after the US had withdrawn support, Hekmatyar ""worked closely"" with bin Laden.",terrorism
"At the same time, a growing number of Arab mujahideen joined the jihad against the Afghan Marxist regime, which was facilitated by international Muslim organizations, particularly the Maktab al-Khidamat (MAK).",terrorism
" In 1984, MAK was established in Peshawar, Pakistan, by bin Laden and Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, a Palestinian Islamic scholar and member of the Muslim Brotherhood.",terrorism
" MAK organized guest houses in Peshawar, near the Afghan border, and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the Afghan war front.",terrorism
 MAK was funded by the Saudi government as well as by individual Muslims including Saudi businessmen.,terrorism
" Bin Laden also became a major financier of the mujahideen, spending his own money and using his connections to influence public opinion about the war.",terrorism
"From 1986, MAK began to set up a network of recruiting offices in the US, the hub of which was the Al Kifah Refugee Center at the Farouq Mosque on Brooklyn's Atlantic Avenue.",terrorism
" Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center were ""double agent"" Ali Mohamed, whom FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called ""bin Laden's first trainer"", and ""Blind Sheikh"" Omar Abdel-Rahman, a leading recruiter of mujahideen for Afghanistan.",terrorism
 Azzam and bin Laden began to establish camps in Afghanistan in 1987.,terrorism
"MAK and foreign mujahideen volunteers, or ""Afghan Arabs"", did not play a major role in the war.",terrorism
" While over 250,000 Afghan mujahideen fought the Soviets and the communist Afghan government, it is estimated that there were never more than two thousand foreign mujahideen on the field at any one time.",terrorism
" Nonetheless, foreign mujahideen volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number who participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000.",terrorism
 Bin Laden played a central role in organizing training camps for the foreign Muslim volunteers.,terrorism
" Mohammad Najibullah's Communist Afghan government lasted for three more years, before it was overrun by elements of the mujahideen.",terrorism
"Toward the end of the Soviet military mission in Afghanistan, some foreign mujahideen wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world, such as Palestine and Kashmir.",terrorism
" A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations.",terrorism
 One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda.,terrorism
"Research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed on August 11, 1988, when a meeting in Afghanistan between leaders of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Abdullah Azzam, and bin Laden took place.",terrorism
 An agreement was reached to link bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.,terrorism
"Notes indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by August 20, 1988.",terrorism
" A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (bayat ) to follow one's superiors.",terrorism
" In his memoir, bin Laden's former bodyguard, Nasser al-Bahri, gives the only publicly available description of the ritual of giving bayat when he swore his allegiance to the al-Qaeda chief.",terrorism
" According to Wright, the group's real name was not used in public pronouncements because ""its existence was still a closely held secret.",terrorism
"""After Azzam was assassinated in 1989 and MAK broke up, significant numbers of MAK followers joined bin Laden's new organization.",terrorism
"In November 1989, Ali Mohamed, a former special forces sergeant stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, left military service and moved to California.",terrorism
" He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and became ""deeply involved with bin Laden's plans.",terrorism
""" In 1991, Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden's relocation to Sudan.",terrorism
"Following the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia.",terrorism
 The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk.,terrorism
" The world's most valuable oil fields were within striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.",terrorism
"In the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were outnumbered.",terrorism
 Bin Laden offered the services of his mujahideen to King Fahd to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army.,terrorism
" The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden's offer, opting instead to allow US and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory.",terrorism
"The deployment angered bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the ""land of the two mosques"" (Mecca and Medina) profaned sacred soil.",terrorism
" After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan.",terrorism
"From around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician Hassan al-Turabi.",terrorism
" The move followed an Islamist coup d'état in Sudan, led by Colonel Omar al-Bashir, who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values.",terrorism
" During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established training camps.",terrorism
"A key turning point for bin Laden occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the Oslo Accords, which set a path for peace between Israel and Palestinians.",terrorism
" Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan on March 5, 1994 demanding bin Laden's passport.",terrorism
" His family was persuaded to cut off his stipend, $7 million a year, and his Saudi assets were frozen.",terrorism
 There is controversy as to what extent bin Laden continued to garner support from members afterwards.,terrorism
"In 1993, a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the Egyptian prime minister, Atef Sedki.",terrorism
" Egyptian public opinion turned against Islamist bombings, and the police arrested 280 of al-Jihad's members and executed 6.",terrorism
" In June 1995, an attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak led to the expulsion of Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ), and in May 1996, of bin Laden from Sudan.",terrorism
"According to Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz, the Sudanese government offered the Clinton Administration numerous opportunities to arrest bin Laden.",terrorism
" Ijaz's claims appeared in numerous op-ed pieces, including one in the Los Angeles Times and one in The Washington Post co-written with former Ambassador to Sudan Timothy M.",terrorism
" Similar allegations have been made by Vanity Fair contributing editor David Rose, and Richard Miniter, author of Losing bin Laden, in a November 2003 interview with World.",terrorism
"Several sources dispute Ijaz's claim, including the 9/11 Commission, which concluded in part: Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the US.",terrorism
 The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so.,terrorism
 Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin.,terrorism
" Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment out-standing.",terrorism
"After the fall of the Afghan communist regime in 1992, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for four years and plagued by constant infighting between various mujahideen groups.",terrorism
" The Taliban also garnered support from graduates of Islamic schools, which are called madrassa.",terrorism
" According to Ahmed Rashid, five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of Darul Uloom Haqqania, a madrassa in the small town of Akora Khattak.",terrorism
" The town is situated near Peshawar in Pakistan, but the school is largely attended by Afghan refugees.",terrorism
" This institution reflected Salafi beliefs in its teachings, and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs.",terrorism
 Four of the Taliban's leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar.,terrorism
" Bin Laden's contacts were laundering donations to these schools, and Islamic banks were used to transfer money to an ""array"" of charities which served as front groups for al-Qaeda.",terrorism
Many of the mujahideen who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi's Harkat i Inqilabi group at the time of the Russian invasion.,terrorism
 This group also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.,terrorism
"The continuing lawlessness enabled the growing and well-disciplined Taliban to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.",terrorism
" In 1994, it captured the regional center of Kandahar, and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter, the Taliban captured the capital city Kabul in September 1996.",terrorism
"In 1996, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan provided a perfect staging ground for al-Qaeda.",terrorism
" While not officially working together, Al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban's protection and supported the regime in such a strong symbiotic relationship that many Western observers dubbed the Taliban's Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as, ""the world's first terrorist-sponsored state.",terrorism
""" However, at this time, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.",terrorism
"While in Afghanistan, the Taliban government tasked al-Qaeda with the training of Brigade 055, an elite element of the Taliban's army.",terrorism
" The Brigade mostly consisted of foreign fighters, veterans from the Soviet Invasion, and adherents to the ideology of the mujahideen.",terrorism
" In November 2001, as Operation Enduring Freedom had toppled the Taliban government, many Brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed, and those who survived were thought to have escaped into Pakistan along with bin Laden.",terrorism
"By the end of 2008, some sources reported that the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda, however, there is reason to doubt this.",terrorism
" According to senior US military intelligence officials, there were fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan in 2009.",terrorism
"Al Qaeda chief, Asim Omar was killed in Afghanistan's Musa Qala district after a joint US–Afghanistan commando airstrike on September 23, Afghan's National Directorate of Security (NDS) confirmed in October 2019.",terrorism
"In a report released May 27, 2020, the United Nations' Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team stated that the Taliban-Al Qaeda relations remain strong to this day and additionally, Al Qaeda itself has admitted that it operates inside Afghanistan.",terrorism
"On July 26, 2020, a United Nations report stated that the Al Qaeda group is still active in twelve provinces in Afghanistan and its leader al-Zawahiri is still based in the country.",terrorism
" and that the UN Monitoring Team estimated that the total number of Al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan were ""between 400 and 600"".",terrorism
"In 1994, the Salafi groups waging Salafi jihadism in Bosnia entered into decline, and groups such as the Egyptian Islamic Jihad began to drift away from the Salafi cause in Europe.",terrorism
 Al-Qaeda stepped in and assumed control of around 80% of non-state armed cells in Bosnia in late 1995.,terrorism
" At the same time, al-Qaeda ideologues instructed the network's recruiters to look for Jihadi international Muslims who believed that extremist-jihad must be fought on a global level.",terrorism
" Al-Qaeda also sought to open the ""offensive phase"" of the global Salafi jihad.",terrorism
" Bosnian Islamists in 2006 called for ""solidarity with Islamic causes around the world"", supporting the insurgents in Kashmir and Iraq as well as the groups fighting for a Palestinian state.",terrorism
"In 1996, al-Qaeda announced its jihad to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered Islamic lands.",terrorism
" Bin Laden issued a fatwa, which amounted to a public declaration of war against the US and its allies, and began to refocus al-Qaeda's resources on large-scale, propagandist strikes.",terrorism
"On February 23, 1998, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, along with three other Islamist leaders, co-signed and issued a fatwa calling on Muslims to kill Americans and their allies.",terrorism
" Under the banner of the World Islamic Front for Combat Against the Jews and Crusaders, they declared:
",terrorism
"[T]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies – civilians and military – is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim.",terrorism
" This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah, 'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together [and] fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah.",terrorism
Neither bin Laden nor al-Zawahiri possessed the traditional Islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a fatwa.,terrorism

US and Iraqi officials accused Al-Qaeda in Iraq of trying to slide Iraq into a full-scale civil war between Iraq's Shiite population and Sunni Arabs.,terrorism
 This was done through an orchestrated campaign of civilian massacres and a number of provocative attacks against high-profile religious targets.,terrorism
" With attacks including the 2003 Imam Ali Mosque bombing, the 2004 Day of Ashura and Karbala and Najaf bombings, the 2006 first al-Askari Mosque bombing in Samarra, the deadly single-day series of bombings in which at least 215 people were killed in Baghdad's Shiite district of Sadr City, and the second al-Askari bombing in 2007, Al-Qaeda in Iraq provoked Shiite militias to unleash a wave of retaliatory attacks, resulting in death squad-style killings and further sectarian violence which escalated in 2006.",terrorism
